    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nWe are a leading online education platform company. Our mission is to expand access to high-quality educational opportunities that unlock human potential. In November 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of edX Inc. (the \u201cedX Acquisition\u201d), including the edX brand, website and marketplace. As a result of the edX Acquisition, we expanded our digital education offerings to include open courses and micro-credential offerings at the undergraduate and graduate levels and added an education consumer marketplace, edx.org, with over 42 million registered learners.\nFollowing the completion of the edX Acquisition, we now serve more than 230 top-ranked global universities and other leading institutions, and offer more than 3,600 high-quality online learning opportunities, including open courses, executive education offerings, boot camps, micro-credentials, professional certificates as well as undergraduate and graduate degree programs.\nWith the edX Acquisition, we are now positioned as one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive free-to-degree online learning platforms. We believe our platform and robust consumer marketplace provide our clients with the digital infrastructure to launch world-class online education offerings and allow students to easily access high-quality, job-relevant education offerings without the barriers of cost or location.\nBusiness Segments\nWe have two reportable segments: the Degree Program Segment and the Alternative Credential Segment.\nIn our Degree Program Segment, we provide the technology and services to nonprofit colleges and universities to enable the online delivery of degree programs. Students enrolled in these programs are generally seeking an undergraduate or graduate degree of the same quality they would receive on campus.\nIn our Alternative Credential Segment, we provide premium online open courses, executive education programs, technical, skills-based boot camps and micro-credential programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels through relationships with nonprofit colleges and universities and other leading institutions. Students enrolled in these offerings are generally seeking to reskill or upskill for career advancement or personal development through shorter duration, lower-priced offerings. Following the edX Acquisition, we changed the name of our \u201cshort courses\u201d in our Alternative Credential Segment to \u201cexecutive education\u201d to more clearly align with industry terminology.\nOur Platform\nOur platform consists of a seamlessly integrated ecosystem of technology, people and data. Through our platform, we provide the tools and services our clients need to bring high-quality online education offerings to students around the world and we provide students an expansive range of offerings to support their educational and career goals.\nDegree Program Segment: Technology and Services\nIn the Degree Program Segment, we provide front-end and back-end cloud-based SaaS technology and technology-enabled services, which are tightly integrated and optimized with data analysis and machine learning techniques.

In addition to interactive asynchronous learning experiences, our offerings feature live, online classes. Live classes provide the opportunity for students to build community with peers and receive personalized and real-time instructor support, which is a cornerstone of our approach to delivering degree programs. To maximize the benefit of these synchronous live sessions, we employ a flipped classroom model, which focuses on dynamic interactive learning rather than solely direct teacher instruction. We also provide technology tools to reduce friction in the virtual learning environment for students and professors.\n\u2022University Support Services. We provide a range of other services to enable the success of our university clients\u2019 online degree programs and allow them to focus on their core academic functions.\n\u25e6Admissions - While our university clients are solely responsible for making admissions decisions, we streamline the admissions process by assisting prospective students in the application process and organizing and routing completed student application packages to the university\u2019s admissions office.\n\u25e6Placement - Using our global network of clinics, hospitals, schools and other sites, our field placement team secures local placements for students enrolled in degree programs such as nursing, social work, teaching and other programs that require field placements to satisfy curriculum and accreditation requirements. We have integrated placements into our learning technology to enable students, faculty and field placement supervisors to monitor completion of student field work directly from our platform. During the COVID-19 pandemic we developed a virtual field placement program for our counseling and social work programs to allow students to continue to progress through these degree programs while in-person placements were not possible.\n\u25e6Faculty Success - We provide a dedicated team to support and train university administration and faculty on how to use our platform to facilitate high-quality live instruction.

We use a learning management system that facilitates authoring and hosting asynchronous learning activities. We employ tools to make real-time updates to our curriculum to keep certain offerings current in quickly evolving fields such as coding, data analytics and cybersecurity. We also use a proprietary analytics platform to capture the sentiment of students in our boot camp and executive education offerings. We use this data to improve our curricula, calibrate differences across classrooms and offer targeted support to students. We also recruit, hire and train faculty to teach the executive education and boot camp offerings for our university clients. For our open course and micro-credential offerings, we provide course strategy and design consultation services and other self-help resources to assist our clients in creating engaging content for our platform.\nedX Marketplace\nOur marketplace, available at edX.org, provides the full catalog of online offerings ranging from free offerings to graduate degree programs that we enable. Once we have completed integration of the edX marketplace with our broader business, we believe this thriving consumer marketplace will enable our clients to efficiently reach a large audience of global learners and expand the impact of their institutions and brands, and allow students to access relevant, high-quality education offerings from top-tier academic institutions and other industry leading entities. We believe the edX marketplace provides an opportunity to increase the efficiency of our marketing efforts by combining the strength of the edX brand and large global audience with a comprehensive range of high-quality education offerings and our strong offering-specific marketing capabilities. As we continue to increase the range of offerings on the edX marketplace, we believe we will attract additional students to the marketplace, some of whom will enroll in additional offerings.\nKey Benefits of our Solution\nWe believe our solutions provide the following key benefits:\n\u2022Extend Institutional Reach and Impact. Our platform enables our university and institutional clients to extend their brands and increase their impact by delivering high-quality education offerings to students anywhere in the world at a wide range of prices and credential levels.\n\u2022Low Financial Risk for Clients. We make many of the initial investments required to launch new offerings across our portfolio. In our Degree Program Segment, in particular, we make significant investments in technology, integration, content production, marketing, student and faculty support, and other services. Our revenue-share model, combined with long contractual terms in this segment, enables us to make these investments without significant financial risk to our university clients. Our platform provides a broad set of capabilities that would otherwise require universities to\npurchase multiple, disparate point solutions, and significantly increase headcount in marketing, data analytics, technology and other areas.\n\u2022Marketing Reach. As part of the edX Acquisition, we acquired edX\u2019s thriving consumer marketplace and global brand. Once we have completed our integration activities, we believe the edX marketplace together with the strong consumer-facing brand, will enable our clients to efficiently reach a large audience of potential students. As we continue to expand the scope of offerings on the edX marketplace, we believe we will generate additional interest in our offerings among students and incentivize clients to create additional offerings on our platform ranging from free-to-degree.\n\u2022Comprehensive Scope of Offerings. We provide a broad range of education offerings to students that range from free open courses to graduate degree programs. Our breadth of offerings allows students to gain the skills and credentials they need to reach their career and personal goals and provides the flexibility to \u201cstack\u201d credentials to progress towards a more advanced credential or degree.\n\u2022Outcomes. Our platform allows students to pursue a wide range of high-quality education offerings provided by leading universities and other top-tier institutions. Through these offerings, students obtain valuable skills and credentials that can create upward career mobility, facilitate a transition to a new field and lead to personal enrichment.\n\u2022Scalable Support. High-quality student support is a central pillar of our platform. We provide student support for all offerings in our portfolio that is tailored to student needs based on offering type. For many of our offerings our support teams work with prospective students prior to enrollment as they consider and apply to a particular offering. Once enrolled, we augment the academic experience by assigning a dedicated advisor to provide ongoing individualized non-academic support and career guidance for certain offerings. For our self-paced offerings such as our open courses, we provide students with platform technical support as needed.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe intend to continue our industry leadership as a provider of a digital education platform that enables our clients to deliver high-quality online education at scale and provides students with lifelong learning opportunities to unlock their potential. Our approach to growth is disciplined and focused on long-term success. The principal elements of our strategy are:\n\u2022Adding Offerings with New and Existing Clients and Increasing Enrollments in Our Offerings. We intend to add additional top-tier universities and other entities to our client base and to increase the number of offerings we power on behalf of our existing client base. We believe that once we have fully integrated the edX marketplace with our existing business, and enhanced search functionality of the marketplace, potential students will be able to more efficiently search for and find courses of interest from free-to-degree. We also intend to scale enrollments in our offerings by expanding the reach and diversity of our marketing channels and making incremental improvements to our learning technology.\n\u2022Expanding Offerings from Free-to-Degree. We intend to continue evolving our offering portfolio to meet the demands of lifelong learners by expanding our offerings in accordance with our client\u2019s roadmaps. This expansion could include new offering types, course bundles or stacks, or additional credentialing options.\n\u2022Expanding Enterprise Channel. We believe expanding our enterprise channel presents a significant opportunity for us. Our deep catalog of over 3,600 high-quality free-to-degree offerings enables us to partner with a wide range of institutions seeking to upskill and train employees at any level of their organizations with exceptional digital learning experiences in job-relevant subject areas.\n\u2022Expanding Globally. The edX marketplace generates significant traffic across the globe and the edX offerings have a large non-US student base. We believe this creates a significant opportunity to expand our offerings with top-tier international universities and other entities and to attract additional non-US students to our existing offerings.\nClients\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had more than 230 clients with more than 3,600 offerings. Our clients are nonprofit colleges and universities as well as leading corporations and non-profit entities.\nCompetition\nThe overall market for technology solutions that enable higher education providers to deliver education online is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting needs of students, faculty and clients and frequent introductions of new delivery methods.\nWe face competition from various companies in the online education sector, including companies that provide direct-to-consumer online education offerings, corporate training programs and technology solutions and services to universities that offer online learning programs. Many of these companies provide components of the technology and services we provide, and these companies may choose to pursue some of the institutions we target. Moreover, nonprofit colleges and universities may elect to continue using or develop their own online learning solutions in-house.\nWe expect that the competitive landscape will continue to expand as the market for online education offerings at nonprofit institutions matures. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\n\u2022quality and reputation of university client base and track record of performance;\n\u2022robustness and evolution of technology solutions and marketplace capabilities;\n\u2022scope and quality of educational content;\n\u2022strength of brand awareness and reputation among consumers;\n\u2022ability of online education offerings to deliver desired student outcomes;\n\u2022breadth and depth of service offering;\n\u2022ability to make significant investments in launching and operating degree programs;\n\u2022expertise in marketing, student acquisition and student retention;\n\u2022student and faculty experience;\n\u2022ease of deployment and use of technology solutions; and\n\u2022level of customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of technology solutions.\nWe believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, to a great extent, on our ability to consistently deliver high-quality offerings; meet client needs for content development; attract, support and retain students; and deliver desired student, faculty and client outcomes.\nSeasonality\nWe experience seasonality in our marketing and sales expense in both our Degree Program Segment and our Alternative Credential Segment. We typically reduce our paid search and other marketing and sales efforts during late November and December because of less demand during the holiday season. We generally do not experience pronounced seasonality in our revenue, although revenue can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to variations driven by the varying academic schedules of our offerings and university clients.\nIntellectual Property\nWe protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual agreements. For example, we rely on trademark protection in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to various marks, including 2U, NO BACK ROW, GETSMARTER, TRILOGY, EDX and other distinctive logos associated with our brand. We continue to evaluate developing and expanding our intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally.\nWe ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party that creates intellectual property for us that assign any intellectual property rights to us.\nWe have also established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business.\nWe also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our technology or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our technology and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.\nFor important additional information related to our intellectual property position, please review the information set forth in \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property.\u201d\nEducation Laws and Regulations\nThe higher education industry is heavily regulated. Institutions of higher education that award degrees and certificates to signify the successful completion of an academic program are subject to regulation from three primary entities: the U.S. Department of Education, or DOE, accrediting agencies and state licensing authorities. Each of these entities promulgates and enforces its own laws, regulations and standards, which we refer to collectively as education laws.\nWe contract with postsecondary institutions that are subject to education laws. In addition, we ourselves are required to comply with certain education laws as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions of higher education, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with university clients. Our failure, or that of our university clients, to comply with education laws could adversely impact our operations. As a result, we work closely with our university clients to maintain compliance with education laws.\nFederal Laws and Regulations\nUnder the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or the HEA, institutions offering postsecondary education must comply with certain laws and related regulations promulgated by the DOE in order to participate in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. Most of our university clients participate in the Title IV programs.\nThe HEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are frequently revised, repealed or expanded. Congress historically has reauthorized and amended the HEA at regular intervals but has failed to do so in recent years. The reauthorization process and congressional oversight of the DOE is nonetheless ongoing, such as oversight and investigations of the education sector and DOE conducted on behalf of Congress by the Government Accountability Office, or GAO.\nThe reauthorization of the HEA, or other legislation, could alter the regulatory landscape of the higher education industry, and thereby impact the manner in which we conduct business and serve our university clients. In addition, the DOE frequently conducts rulemakings that may impact our business and we expect each incoming administration to change the DOE rules in accordance with its policy priorities regardless of whether the HEA is reauthorized by Congress. The DOE also issues formal and informal guidance instructing institutions of higher education and other covered entities how to comply with various federal laws and regulations. DOE guidance is subject to change and such changes may impact our business model.\nAlthough we are not considered an institution of higher education and we do not directly participate in Title IV programs, we are required to comply with certain regulations promulgated by the DOE as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions that do participate in Title IV programs. These include, for example, regulations governing student privacy under Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA. While online executive education courses and boot camps are typically not eligible for Title IV aid, when offered by or on behalf of Title IV eligible institutions, many education laws, such as FERPA, remain applicable to us or our university clients even in the Alternative Credential Segment.\nCurrent DOE rules material to our business include the incentive compensation rule, the misrepresentation rule, the \u201cwritten arrangements\u201d rules and state authorization requirements, which are discussed in further detail below.\nIncentive Compensation Rule\nThe HEA provides that any institution that participates in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs must agree with the DOE that the institution will not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities as those terms and activities are defined in DOE regulations and policy guidance.\nUnder DOE\u2019s incentive compensation regulations, each higher education institution agrees that it will not \u201cprovide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV, HEA program funds.\u201d Pursuant to this rule, we are prohibited from offering our covered employees, who are those involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities, any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students into a postsecondary institution.\nAt the time the incentive compensation rule was last revised, in July 2011, the revised rule initially raised a question as to whether entities could be prohibited from entering into tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with university clients. On March 17, 2011, the DOE issued official agency guidance, known as a \u201cDear Colleague Letter,\u201d or the DCL, providing guidance on this point. The DCL states that \u201c[t]he Department generally views payment based on the amount of tuition generated as an indirect payment of incentive compensation based on success in recruitment and therefore a prohibited basis upon which to measure the value of the services provided\u201d and that \u201c[t]his is true regardless of the manner in which the entity compensates its employees.\u201d But the DCL also provides an important exception to the ban on tuition revenue-sharing arrangements between institutions and third parties. According to the DCL, the DOE does not consider payment based on the\namount of tuition generated by an institution to violate the incentive compensation ban if the payment compensates an \u201cunaffiliated third party\u201d that provides a set of \u201cbundled services\u201d that includes recruitment services, such as those we provide. Example 2-B in the DCL is described as a \u201cpossible business model\u201d developed \u201cwith the statutory mandate in mind.\u201d Example 2-B describes the following as a possible business model:\n\u201cA third party that is not affiliated with the institution it serves and is not affiliated with any other institution that provides educational services, provides bundled services to the institution including marketing, enrollment application assistance, recruitment services, course support for online delivery of courses, the provision of technology, placement services for internships, and student career counseling. The institution may pay the entity an amount based on tuition generated for the institution by the entity\u2019s activities for all the bundled services that are offered and provided collectively, as long as the entity does not make prohibited compensation payments to its employees, and the institution does not pay the entity separately for student recruitment services provided by the entity.\u201d\nThe DCL guidance indicates that an arrangement that complies with Example 2-B will be deemed to be in compliance with the incentive compensation provisions of the HEA and the DOE\u2019s regulations. Our business model and contractual arrangements with our university clients closely follow Example 2-B in the DCL. In addition, we assure that none of our \u201ccovered employees\u201d are paid any bonus or other incentive compensation in violation of the rule.\nBecause the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by the DOE in the form of a DCL and is not codified by statute or regulation, the rule could technically be altered or removed without customary administrative procedural requirements, such as adequate prior notice, that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Similarly, a court could invalidate the rule in an action involving our company or our university clients, or in an action that does not involve us at all. Finally, while most states defer to DOE regulations, different versions of the federal incentive compensation rule exist under state law, and such statutes or rules, or their interpretation, may change at any time. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, the DOE or a court could require us to change our business model, and separate revisions at the state level could require us to amend certain of our contracts.\nMisrepresentation Rule\nThe HEA prohibits an institution that participates in the Title IV programs from engaging in any \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d regarding three broad subject areas: (i) the nature of the school\u2019s education programs, (ii) the school\u2019s financial charges and (iii) the employability of the school\u2019s graduates.\nUnder the DOE rule, \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d is defined broadly as any false, erroneous or misleading statement, written, visual or oral. This may include even statements that \u201chave the likelihood or tendency to deceive.\u201d Therefore, a statement need not be intentionally deceitful to qualify as a misrepresentation. \u201cSubstantial misrepresentation\u201d is defined loosely as a misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person\u2019s detriment.\nThe regulation also covers statements made by any representative of an institution, including agents, employees and subcontractors, and statements made directly or indirectly to any third party, including state agencies, government officials or the public, and not just statements made to students or prospective students.\nViolations of the misrepresentation rule are subject to various sanctions by the DOE and violations may be used as a basis for legal action by third parties or as a defense to the obligation to repay student loans. The DOE rules regarding misrepresentation change frequently and DOE has indicated it may revise aspects of the rule and related student recruiting standards as part of its ongoing rulemakings. In addition, the DOE has designated an investigations unit to enforce rules related to deceptive student marketing, which is expected to work with other federal agencies.\nSimilar rules apply under state laws or are incorporated in institutional accreditation standards, and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, applies similar rules that prohibit any unfair or deceptive marketing practices by vendors in the education sector. As a result, we and our employees and subcontractors, as agents of our university clients, must use a high degree of care to comply with such rules and are prohibited by contract from making any false, erroneous or misleading statements about our university clients. To avoid an issue under the misrepresentation rule and similar state and federal rules, we assure that all marketing materials are approved in advance by our university clients before they are used by our employees.\nAccreditation Rules and Standards\nAccrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the instructional programs of an educational institution, and a grant of accreditation is typically viewed as confirmation that an institution or an institution\u2019s programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources to perform its educational mission. The DOE also relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether institutions qualify to participate in Title IV programs.\nIn addition to institutional accreditation, colleges and universities may require specialized programmatic accreditation for particular educational programs. Many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited, and require individuals to have graduated from accredited programs in order to sit for professional license exams. Programmatic accreditation, while not a sufficient basis for institutional Title IV Program certification by the DOE, assists graduates to practice or otherwise secure appropriate employment in their chosen field. Common fields of study subject to programmatic accreditation include teaching and nursing.\nAlthough we are not an accredited institution and are not required to maintain accreditation, accrediting agencies are responsible for reviewing an accredited institution\u2019s third-party contracts with service providers like us and may require an institution to obtain approval from or to notify the accreditor in connection with such arrangements. One purpose of the notification and approval requirements is to verify that the accredited institution remains responsible for providing academic instruction leading to a credential and provides oversight of other activities undertaken by third parties like us that are within the scope of its accreditation. We work closely with our university clients to assure that the standards of their respective accreditors are met and are not adversely impacted by us.\nAccrediting agencies are also responsible for assuring that any \u201cwritten arrangements\u201d to outsource academic instruction meet accreditation standards and related regulations of the DOE. Our operations are generally not subject to such \u201cwritten arrangements\u201d rules because academic instruction is provided by our university client institutions and not by us; however, the \u201cwritten arrangements\u201d rules may apply to online programs in the Alternative Credential Segment to the extent such courses are outsourced by university clients.\nState Laws and Regulations\nEach state has at least one licensing agency responsible for the oversight of educational institutions operating within its jurisdiction. Continued approval by such agencies is necessary for an institution to operate and grant degrees, diplomas or certificates in those states. Moreover, under the HEA, approval by such agencies is necessary to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. State attorneys general are also active in enforcing education laws, and the level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state.\nWe and our university clients may be subject to regulation in each state in which we or they own facilities, provide distance education or recruit students. State laws establish standards for, among other things, student instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, recruiting practices and financial policies. The need to comply with applicable state laws and regulations may limit or delay our ability to market or expand our offerings. In addition, the interpretation of state authorization regulations is subject to substantial discretion by the state agency responsible for enforcing the regulations.\nDOE requires, among other things, that an institution offering distance learning or online programs secure the approval of those states which require such approval and provide evidence of such approval to the DOE upon request. This regulation increases the importance of state authorization because failure to obtain the necessary state authorization for online programs (which may also be obtained through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement) could result in an obligation to return federal funds received by an institution. The federal state authorization rules were updated in July 2020 to, among other things, require more detailed disclosure requirements about whether particular states have authorized programs that may lead to professional licensure, which created an additional compliance burden for many of our partner institutions. The DOE is currently considering further changes to its state authorization requirements.\nAll states except California now participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, governing the licensing of online offerings. All SARA-member institutions may provide online offerings in SARA states without obtaining separate state authorization (this includes externships, recruiting, local advertising, and faculty presence). SARA-member institutions must still obtain a separate authorization in order to open a physical location in another state and are also required to obtain any additional approvals that may be required for offerings leading to professional licensure in a state (e.g., nursing, teaching, or counseling). Most of our university clients are SARA members and the DOE accepts participation in a reciprocity agreement as evidence of state approval.\nFinally, many programs leading to professional licensure, such as graduate degree programs in nursing or teaching, also require approval from, and are subject to ongoing oversight by separate state agencies such as state nursing boards. Membership in SARA does not encompass approvals by professional licensing boards, which must be obtained separately.\nWe monitor state law developments closely and work closely with our university clients to assist them with obtaining any required approvals.\nOther Laws\nOur activities or those of our university clients are also subject to other federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, consumer marketing and unfair trade practices laws and regulations, including those promulgated and enforced by the FTC, state and federal consumer lending laws, including those enforced by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, student accessibility requirements, federal and state data protection and privacy requirements and foreign and U.S. anti-corruption regulations.\nHuman Capital Resources\nGeneral Information About Our Human Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,982 full-time employees and 3,206 part-time employees worldwide. Approximately 6,220 of our employees are located in the U.S., approximately 835 of our employees are located in Cape Town, South Africa, and approximately 133 employees are located in other jurisdictions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nOur Culture\n2U was founded on a set of \u201cguiding principles\u201d that are core to our culture and guide big and small decisions every day. New employees are introduced to the guiding principles in orientation and are expected to bring these guiding principles to life as they work with their teams, interact with our university clients and students or otherwise represent 2U in the community.\n\u2022Cherish each opportunity. Life is short, so treasure every moment.\n\u2022Give a damn. Care about what you do each day.\n\u2022Strive for excellence. Don\u2019t settle for second best.\n\u2022Be bold and fearless. Question the status quo and embrace change.\n\u2022Be candid, honest and open. Listen to others and offer respectful feedback.\n\u2022Have fun. Fun is important. Fun is simply better.\n\u2022Make service your mission. Give the highest level of support to our partners and to one another.\n\u2022Don\u2019t let the skeptic win. \u201cNo\u201d is easy. \u201cYes\u201d is hard. Fight for \u201cyes.\u201d\n\u2022Relationships matter. Invest the time, build trust, and value differences.\nHuman Capital Measures and Objectives\n2U is dedicated to eliminating the back row in higher education and our employees are critical to achieving this mission. We believe that when our employees feel appreciated and included they can be more creative, innovative, and better serve our university clients and students. Human capital measures and objectives that we focus on in managing our business include talent acquisition and retention, diversity and inclusion, employee development and training, community involvement and employee experience and wellness.\n\u2022Talent Acquisition and Retention. We seek to recruit, retain and incentivize highly talented employees and our compensation and benefits programs are aligned with these goals. We are committed to providing total rewards programs for our employees that are market-competitive and based on each employee\u2019s contribution and performance. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with stockholders, we provide equity compensation in the form of performance and service-based restricted stock units to eligible employees under our broad-based stock compensation program. We also offer eligible employees the ability to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which enables them to purchase shares of our stock at a discount. We also provide\ncomprehensive benefits for employees and their families, which are tailored to the various geographies in which we operate. Depending on the jurisdiction, our benefits may include health insurance coverage, 401(k) matching, paid parental leave, and unlimited paid time off.\n\u2022Diversity and Inclusion. We believe an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions and results in better outcomes for our university clients and students. We strive to attract, retain and promote diverse talent at all levels of the organization. Our Board is 27% women and 27% people of color and our executive team is 28% women and 33% people of color. We have established a diversity and inclusion committee, known as MOSAIC, that serves as a liaison with management on diversity and inclusion issues and we maintain executive-sponsored business resource networks (\u201cBRNs\u201d) that offer a forum for employees to network and engage in professional development activities. As of December 31, 2021 we had 6 BRNs focused on the following groups: Black/African American, Women, LGBTQ+, Asian Pacific Islander, Latinx and People Who Are Differently Abled. To further support our diversity and inclusion goals, starting in 2020 the Company bonus plan included a diversity and inclusion component for our employees at and above the vice president level.\n\u2022Employee Development and Training. We provide a range of mandatory and optional employee development programs and opportunities for employees to develop the skills they need to be successful. Our learning and development teams create and teach a variety of live courses and our employees also have free access to a library of learning resources via LinkedIn Learning. Our diversity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training programs. We require all managers to complete trainings on allyship, unconscious bias, cultural communication and thriving across differences and we offer additional training on emotional intelligence and leading with empathy. In addition, we offer a tuition reimbursement benefit for employees, which allows eligible employees and their family members to receive reimbursement for completion of certain of our offerings.\n\u2022Community Involvement. We are committed to making an impact in our local communities through volunteering, financial donations, scholarships and other forms of engagement. Our corporate social responsibility program, \u201c2U Engage\u201d, supports local non-profit organizations in each location where we have a 2U office with a focus on organizations that are aligned with our mission to provide access to quality education. Employees are encouraged to volunteer for these organizations throughout the year using our \u201cVolunteer Paid Time Off\u201d program and bi-annually through Company-organized \u201cDays of Service\u201d events. We also endeavor to support the local community through scholarship initiatives, which focus on reaching the Black, Latinx and indigenous communities, as well as women and individuals from low income households.\n\u2022Employee Experience and Wellness. We strive to create employee programs that promote our guiding principles, support employee wellness and enable employees to work productively. Particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic with our global workforce working primarily remotely, supporting and engaging our employees has been our top priority. These efforts include providing access to free wellness resources such as meditation and mental health support, monthly stipends for home Wi-Fi access, a Company-wide \u201cDaily Dose of Team Time\u201d call to foster employee engagement and connection and hosting remote-versions of our annual employee events. We regularly survey our employees to assess wellness and additional support needs.\nOther Information\nWe were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in April 2008 and completed our initial public offering in April 2014.

Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in this section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and summarized below. This risk factor summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the risk factor summary together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth following this section as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\n\u2022Our business, results of operations, and financial condition have been, and could continue to be, affected by COVID-19.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\n\u2022We have incurred significant net losses since inception and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\u2022Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to recruit potential students for our offerings, and our ability to do so may be affected by circumstances beyond our control.\n\u2022Our business depends heavily on the adoption by colleges and universities of online delivery of their educational offerings.\n\u2022To launch a new degree program, we typically must incur significant expense in technology and content development, as well as in marketing and sales to identify and attract prospective students, and it may be several years, if ever, before we generate revenue from a new program sufficient to recover our costs.\n\u2022If new offerings do not scale efficiently and in the time frames we expect, our reputation and our revenue will suffer.\n\u2022Our financial performance depends heavily on student retention within our offerings, and factors influencing student retention may be out of our control.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Our Growth Strategy\n\u2022Our student acquisition efforts depend in large part upon a limited number of third-party advertising platforms.\n\u2022If our security measures or those of our third-party service providers are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data, we could lose clients, fail to attract new clients and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation.\n\u2022Disruption to or failures of our platform could reduce client and student satisfaction with our offerings and could harm our reputation.\n\u2022We face competition from established and emerging companies, which could divert clients or students to our competitors, result in pricing pressure and significantly reduce our revenue.\n\u2022If we do not retain our senior management team and key employees, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives.\nRisks Related to the edX Acquisition and the Combined Company\n\u2022We may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of edX into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the edX Acquisition.\n\u2022We have incurred substantial transaction and integration expenses related to the edX Acquisition and expect to incur additional integration expenses related to edX that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\n\u2022If students do not expand beyond the free offerings available on our platform, our ability to grow our business and improve our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capital Structure\n\u2022Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\n\u2022Despite current indebtedness levels and existing restrictive covenants, we may still incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\n\u2022To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\n\u2022We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\n\u2022Conversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\n\u2022We may need additional capital in the future to pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise our ability to grow our business.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Business and That of Our University Clients\n\u2022Our business model relies on university client institutions complying with federal and state laws and regulations.\n\u2022Our activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations and other requirements.\n\u2022Activities of the U.S. Congress or DOE could result in adverse legislation or regulatory actions or investigations.\n\u2022Our business model, which depends in part on our ability to receive a share of tuition revenue as payment from our university clients, has been validated by a DOE \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter, but such validation is not codified by statute or regulation and may be subject to change.\n\u2022If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our university clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities.\n\u2022Our future growth could be impaired if our university clients fail to obtain timely approval from applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs, make substantive changes to existing programs or expand their programs into or within certain states.\n\u2022Evolving regulations and legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and information security and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition have been, and could continue to be, affected by COVID-19.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, significant disruptions to the flow of the economy, significant volatility and uncertainty in the global financial markets and disruptions to the normal operations of many businesses, including ours. Furthermore, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, new variants of the virus are emerging and many jurisdictions are seeing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, resulting in governments and businesses implementing additional measures in the interest of public health. As such, we cannot predict, with any degree of certainty, the ultimate duration and severity of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to the pandemic on the global economy and our business, or the likelihood or frequency of future resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar major public health concerns.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to protect and assist our employees, including implementing remote and flexible work policies, limiting non-essential business travel, postponing, cancelling or converting to virtual-only certain industry, analyst and employee events and implementing a vaccine policy for employees.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, as well as measures undertaken to contain the spread of COVID-19, including the measures we have taken, has caused disruptions to our business, including volatility in demand for our offerings from students and in\nstudent retention rates and fluctuations in marketing costs from period to period. Disruptions and impacts to our business in the future may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022causing one or more of our university clients to file for bankruptcy protection or shut down;\n\u2022reducing student demand for our offerings;\n\u2022impacting current and prospective university clients\u2019 desire to launch new educational offerings with us;\n\u2022impacting collections of accounts receivable;\n\u2022impacting our ability to facilitate in-program placements for students in clinical graduate programs;\n\u2022impacting student retention rates in our offerings;\n\u2022increasing cyberattacks and security challenges as our employees and those of our clients and third-party service providers work remotely from networks that may be less secure;\n\u2022impacting the efficiency of our marketing activities;\n\u2022creating difficulties or delays in ramping, training and retaining new employees in an effective manner;\n\u2022imposing negative physical and mental health impacts on, and resulting unavailability or reduced productivity of, our key executives or other employees as a result of such employees or their family members contracting the virus, being placed in quarantine or self-isolation, being in jurisdictions where travel or other activities remain restricted, or due to prolonged social isolation or distancing measures;\n\u2022delaying the anticipated launch dates of our offerings;\n\u2022changing our internal controls, policies and procedures due to remote work arrangements, which may result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls in the preparation of our financial reports and resulting increased costs of controls and compliance oversight activities; and\n\u2022harming our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and reactions thereto will continue and how our business and results of operation will be impacted as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve or subside. As a result, we expect to face difficulty accurately predicting our internal financial forecasts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks identified in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. It is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition at this time, but such effects may be material.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\nOur limited operating history, and the evolving scope of our offerings, make it difficult to predict our future financial and operating results, and we may not achieve our expected financial and operating results in the future.\nWe were incorporated in 2008 and launched our first graduate program in 2009. In July 2017, we acquired GetSmarter and extended our offerings to include premium online executive education programs and in May 2019, we acquired Trilogy and further extended our offerings to include skills-based boot camps. In November 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of edX, which expanded our offerings to include open courses and micro-credentials and added a consumer facing marketplace. As a result of our limited operating history, and the evolving scope of our offerings, our ability to forecast our future operating results, including revenue, cash flows and profitability, is limited and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change, or if we do not manage these risks successfully, our operating and financial results may differ materially from our expectations and our business may suffer.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe incurred net losses of $194.8 million, $216.5 million and $235.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on technology and production efforts to support a growing number of offerings and our marketing and sales efforts to drive the acquisition of potential students. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our operating expenses. If we are forced to reduce our expenses, our growth strategy could be compromised. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. As a result, we may be unable to achieve and maintain profitability, and the value of our company and our common stock could decline significantly.\nOur financial performance depends heavily on our ability to recruit potential students for our offerings, and our ability to do so may be affected by circumstances beyond our control.\nBuilding awareness of our offerings is critical to our ability to recruit prospective students for our university clients\u2019 offerings and generate revenue. A substantial portion of our expenses is attributable to marketing and sales efforts dedicated to attracting potential students to our offerings. Because we generate revenue based on a portion of the tuition and fees that students pay, it is critical to our success that we identify prospective students for our offerings in a cost-effective manner, and that enrolled students remain active in our offerings until graduation or completion.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, fluctuations in our student enrollments based on a variety of factors. For example, student enrollments have declined, and may decline in the future, due to our university clients changing their admissions standards. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant fluctuations in student enrollment across our offerings and we are unable to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student enrollments in the future.\nThe following factors, many of which are largely outside of our control, may prevent us from successfully driving and maintaining student enrollment in our offerings in a cost-effective manner or at all, which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to achieve profitability:\n\u2022Negative perceptions about online learning programs. Online offerings that we or our competitors provide may not be successful or operate efficiently, and new entrants to the market also may not perform well. Such underperformance could create the perception that online offerings in general are not an effective way to educate students, whether or not our offerings achieve satisfactory performance.\n\u2022Unsuccessful marketing efforts. We invest substantial resources in developing and implementing data-driven marketing strategies that focus on identifying the right potential student at the right time. These marketing efforts make substantial use of search engine optimization, paid search, social media and custom website development and deployment and we rely on a small number of internet search engines and marketing partners. The effectiveness and cost of our marketing efforts has varied over time and from offering to offering based on economic conditions, competition, advertising prices, offerings type, university client reputation and other factors.\n\u2022Damage to university client reputation. Because we often use a university client\u2019s brand in connection with our marketing efforts for their offerings, our university clients\u2019 reputations are critical to our ability to enroll students. Many factors affecting our university clients\u2019 reputations are beyond our control, including ranking among nonprofit educational institutions, internal university matters, changes in university leadership positions and other matters that impact the public perception of our university clients.\n\u2022Lack of interest in an offering. We may encounter difficulties attracting students for offerings that are not highly desired or that are relatively new within their fields. Macroeconomic conditions beyond our control may diminish interest in employment in a field, which could contribute to a lack of interest in offerings related to that field.\n\u2022Reduced support from our university clients. Our ability to grow our revenue from a particular offering depends on the growth of enrollment in that offering. Our university clients could limit enrollment in certain offerings, cease providing the offerings altogether or significantly curtail or inhibit our ability to promote their offerings, any of which would negatively impact our revenue.\n\u2022Our lack of control over our university clients\u2019 admissions standards and admissions decisions for degree programs. Even if we identify prospective students for a degree program, there is no guarantee that our university clients will admit these students to that program. Our university clients retain complete discretion over setting admissions standards and making admissions decisions, and university clients may change admissions standards or inconsistently apply admissions standards.\n\u2022Inability to maintain sufficient high-quality content from our partners. Our success depends on our ability to provide students with high-quality learning experiences. For certain of our offerings, including our degree programs, while our clients are primarily responsible for curriculum development our learning design and development experts collaborate with faculty to ensure the final course content is engaging and digestible in an online format. For other offerings, including our open course and micro-credential offerings, our clients are solely responsible for curriculum development and we provide limited self-help resources. If the course content in our offerings is not high-quality and students are dissatisfied with their experience in an offering on our platform or do not find the content of our offerings appealing, they may stop accessing our content. In turn, if clients perceive that our platform lacks an adequate learner audience, clients may be less willing to provide content to offer on our platform, and the experience of students could be further negatively impacted.\n\u2022Inability of students to secure funding. Like on-campus college and university students, many of the students in our university clients\u2019 offerings, in particular degree programs and boot camps, rely on the availability of third-party financing to pay for tuition and other costs of their education. This may include federal or private student loans, scholarships and grants, or benefits or reimbursement provided by an employer. Any developments that reduce the availability or increase the cost of financial aid for higher education generally, or for our university clients\u2019 offerings, could impair students\u2019 abilities to meet their financial obligations and could negatively impact future enrollment in our offerings.\n\u2022General economic conditions. Student enrollment in our offerings may be affected by changes in global economic conditions, including changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. An improvement in economic conditions and, in particular, an improvement in the economic conditions in the U.S. and the U.S. unemployment rate, may reduce demand among potential students for educational services, as they may find adequate employment without additional education. Conversely, a worsening of economic and employment conditions may reduce the willingness of employers to sponsor educational opportunities for their employees or discourage existing or potential students from pursuing additional education due to a perception that there are insufficient job opportunities, increased economic uncertainty or other factors.\nOur business depends heavily on the adoption by colleges and universities of online delivery of their educational offerings. If we fail to attract new university clients, or if new leadership at existing university clients does not have an interest in continuing or expanding online delivery of their educational offerings, our revenue growth and profitability may suffer.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to enter into agreements with additional nonprofit colleges and universities to provide their offerings online. In particular, to engage new university clients, we need to convince potential university clients, many of which have been educating students only in on-campus programs for hundreds of years, to invest significant time and resources to introduce a new teaching modality. The delivery of online education at leading nonprofit colleges and universities is evolving, but many administrators and faculty members continue to have concern regarding the perceived loss of control over the education process that might result from offering content online, as well as skepticism regarding the ability of colleges and universities to provide high-quality education online that maintains the standards they set for their on-campus programs. It may be difficult to overcome this resistance, and online offering of the kind we develop with our university clients may not achieve significant market acceptance. In addition, our university clients have regular turnover in their leadership positions, and there is no guarantee that any new leader will have an interest in continuing or expanding online delivery of the university\u2019s educational offerings. If new leaders at our university clients do not embrace online delivery of educational offerings, we may not be able to add additional offerings with the university client and the university client may attempt to terminate or may not renew their relationship with us.\nThe market for our offerings may be limited based on the types of nonprofit colleges and universities we target and due to exclusivity provisions in certain of our contracts with university clients. We have agreed to incur, and we may incur in the future, costs to terminate some or all of the exclusivity obligations in certain of our university client contracts.\nCertain of our contracts with our university clients limit our ability to enable competitive offerings with other schools. In our Degree Program Segment, we have determined that enabling some of these contractually prohibited competitive programs may be part of our business strategy. We have in the past agreed and may in the future agree with certain university clients to do some or all of the following to reduce or eliminate certain exclusivity obligations: make fixed and contingent cash payments over time, reduce our revenue share over time, and/or make minimum investments in marketing under certain conditions.\nIn addition, in order to maintain good relations with our university clients, we may decide not to approach certain institutions that our university clients regard as their direct competitors to offer similar programs or courses, even if we are allowed to do so under our contracts. A limited number of our contracts with our university clients include provisions that may result in pricing adjustment in limited circumstances. If we need to incur contingent costs in connection with enabling\ncompetitive offerings or if we determine not to approach certain institutions, or if we have to adjust our pricing provisions, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability would be impaired.\nTo launch a new degree program, we generally incur significant expense in technology and content development, as well as in marketing and sales to identify and attract prospective students, and it may be several years, if ever, before we generate revenue from a new program sufficient to recover our costs.\nTo launch a new degree program, we generally integrate components of our platform with the various student information and other operating systems our university clients use to manage functions within their institutions. In addition, for these degree programs, our content development staff works closely with the university client\u2019s faculty members to produce engaging online coursework and content, and we must commence student acquisition activities. This process is time-consuming and costly and, under our agreements with our university clients, we are primarily responsible for the significant costs of this effort for most of our degree programs, even before we generate any revenue and there is no guarantee we will ever recoup these costs.\nIn exchange for the upfront investments we make in our university clients\u2019 degree programs, our university client agreements generally provide that we receive a fixed percentage of the tuition that the university clients receive from the students enrolled in their degree programs. We only begin to recover these upfront costs once students are enrolled and our university clients begin billing students for tuition and fees. The time that it takes for us to recover our investment in a new degree program depends on a variety of factors, primarily our content development costs, student acquisition costs, the rate of growth in student enrollment in the program, and the tuition of the program. We estimate that, on average, it takes approximately three years after signing an agreement with a university client to fully recover our investment in that university client\u2019s new degree program. Because of the lengthy period required to recoup our investment in these new degree programs, unexpected developments beyond our control could occur that result in the university client ceasing or significantly curtailing a degree program before we are able to fully recoup our investment. As a result, we may ultimately be unable to recover the full investment that we make in a new degree program or achieve our expected level of profitability for the degree program.\nIf new offerings do not scale efficiently and in the time frames we expect, our reputation and our revenue will suffer.\nOur continued growth and ability to achieve profitability depends on our and our university clients\u2019 ability to successfully scale newly launched offerings. Our ability to scale new offerings in the time frame we expect has varied over time and from offering to offering. If we are not successful in recruiting potential students for our offerings, it would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, and our university clients and the students in their offerings could lose confidence in the knowledge and capability of our employees. If we cannot quickly and efficiently scale our technology to handle growing student enrollment and new offerings, our university clients\u2019 and their students\u2019 experiences may suffer, which could damage our reputation among colleges and universities and their faculty and students and impact our ability to acquire new university clients.\nIn addition, in our Degree Program Segment, if our university clients cannot quickly develop the infrastructure and hire sufficient faculty and administrators to handle growing student enrollments, our university clients\u2019 and their students\u2019 experiences with our platform may suffer, which could damage our reputation among colleges and universities and their faculty and students.\nOur ability to efficiently scale new offerings will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022satisfy existing students in, and attract and enroll new students for, our offerings;\n\u2022assist our university clients in recruiting qualified faculty to support their expanding enrollments;\n\u2022assist our university clients in developing and producing an increased volume of course content;\n\u2022successfully introduce new features and enhancements and maintain a high level of functionality in our platform; and\n\u2022deliver high-quality support to our university clients and their faculty and students.\nIf student enrollment in our offerings does not increase, if we are unable to launch new offerings in a cost-effective manner or if we are otherwise unable to manage new offerings effectively, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability would be impaired, and the quality of our platform and the satisfaction of our university clients and their students could suffer.\nOur financial performance depends heavily on student retention within our offerings, and factors influencing student retention may be out of our control.\nOnce a student is enrolled in an offering, we and our university client must retain the student over the life of the offering to generate ongoing revenue. Our strategy involves offering high-quality support to students enrolled in these offerings to support their retention. If we are unable to help students quickly resolve any educational, technological or logistical issues they encounter, otherwise provide effective ongoing support to students or deliver high-quality, engaging educational content, students may withdraw from the offering, which would negatively impact our revenue.\nIn addition, student retention could be compromised by the following factors, many of which are largely outside of our control:\n\u2022Lack of support from faculty members in our university clients\u2019 degree programs. It takes a significant time commitment and dedication from our university clients\u2019 faculty members to work with us to develop or to independently develop course content for their degree programs and other courses designed for an online learning environment. Our university clients\u2019 faculty may be unfamiliar with the development and production process, may not understand the time commitment involved, or may otherwise be resistant to changing the ways in which they present the same content in an on-campus class. Our ability to maintain high student retention will depend in part on our ability to convince our university clients\u2019 faculty of the value in the time and effort they will spend developing the course content. Lack of support from faculty could cause the quality of our degree programs to decline, which could contribute to decreased student satisfaction and retention in our Degree Program Segment.\n\u2022Student dissatisfaction. Enrolled students may drop out of our offerings based on their individual perceptions of the value they are getting from the offering. For example, we may face retention challenges as a result of students\u2019 dissatisfaction with our university clients\u2019 faculty, changing views of the value of our offerings and perceptions of employment prospects following completion of the offering.\n\u2022Personal factors. Personal factors, such as ability to continue to pay tuition, ability to meet the rigorous demands of the offering, and lack of time to continue classes, all of which are generally beyond our control, may impact a student\u2019s willingness and ability to stay enrolled in an offering.\nIf student retention is compromised by any of these factors, it could significantly reduce the revenue that we generate from our offerings, which would negatively impact our return on investment for the particular offering and could compromise our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability.\nThe loss, or material underperformance, of any one of our offerings could harm our reputation, which could in turn affect our future revenue growth.\nWe rely on our reputation for delivering high-quality online degree programs and alternative credential offerings and recommendations from existing university clients to attract potential new university clients. Therefore, the loss of any single offering, or the failure of any university client to renew its agreement with us upon expiration, could harm our reputation and impair our ability to pursue our growth strategy and ultimately to become profitable.\nThe recent, significant decline in the market price of our common stock could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial position.\nOur goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, as of October 1, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below carrying value. We experienced a significant decline in the market price of our common stock subsequent to February 9, 2022 and management is evaluating whether this decline represents a triggering event for assessing the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances for impairment in the first quarter of 2022. There is the potential for a non-cash charge in the first quarter of 2022 to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. If it is determined that an impairment loss should be recognized on goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets, our business, results of operations, and financial position could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Our Growth Strategy\nOur student acquisition efforts depend in large part upon a limited number of third-party advertising platforms.\nOur marketing efforts make substantial use of paid search, social media, search engine optimization and custom website development and deployment and we rely on advertising through a limited number of third-party advertising platforms such as Google, Meta Platforms and LinkedIn, to direct traffic to, and recruit new students for, our offerings. Changes in the way these platforms operate - whether due to changes in law, changes in the practices of mobile operating system providers, or otherwise - or changes in their advertising prices, data use practices, or other terms have impacted the cost and efficiency of our student acquisition efforts in the past and could in the future make marketing our offerings more expensive, or more difficult. In addition, the elimination of a particular medium or platform on which we advertise, could limit our ability to direct traffic to our offerings and recruit new students on a cost-effective basis, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf internet search engines\u2019 methodologies are modified, our search engine optimization capability in connection with our student recruiting efforts could be harmed.\nOur search engine optimization capability in connection with our student acquisition efforts substantially depends on various internet search engines, such as Google, to direct a significant amount of traffic to websites related to our offerings. Our ability to influence the number of visitors directed to these websites through search engines is not entirely within our control. For example, search engines frequently revise their algorithms in an attempt to optimize their search result listings. In this respect, we have experienced fluctuations in our search result listings and website traffic based on changes to search engine algorithms, and future algorithm changes by Google or any other search engines could cause the websites for our offerings to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of prospective students who visit these websites and impact our ability to effectively utilize search engine optimization as part of our student acquisition strategies in the long-term. Further, if our competitors\u2019 search engine optimization efforts are more successful than ours, fewer prospective students may be directed to our websites.\nIn October 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against Google claiming that Google improperly uses its monopoly over internet search to impede competition and harm consumers. We cannot predict the impact that this lawsuit may have on advertising costs or Google\u2019s future operations. Any reduction in the number of prospective students directed to our websites could negatively affect our ability to generate prospective students, and ultimately revenue, through our student acquisition activities.\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party service providers are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data, we could lose clients, fail to attract new clients and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation.\nOur platforms and computer systems store and transmit proprietary and confidential client, student, and company information, which may include personal information of students, prospective students, faculty and employees, that are subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As a technology company, we have faced and continue to face an increasing number of threats to our platforms and computer systems, including unauthorized activity and access, system viruses, worms, malicious code, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, social engineering attacks, and organized cyberattacks, any of which could breach our security and create a data exfiltration condition and/or disrupt our platform and our clients\u2019 offerings. The techniques used by computer hackers and cyber criminals to obtain unauthorized access to data or to sabotage computer systems are growing in sophistication, change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, an increasing number of cybersecurity threats to our platform and computer systems and to the systems of our third-party service providers and our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our platform, and the cybersecurity measures taken by our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent all attempts to compromise our systems. While there can be no assurances of effectiveness, we have implemented certain safeguards and processes to thwart hackers, and all related activity, and protect the data in our platforms and computer systems. If our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, it could result in the loss or misuse of proprietary and confidential university, student (including prospective student), employee or company information, which could subject us to material liability, or materially interrupt our business, potentially over an extended period of time. Any such event could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract new clients and students, cause existing clients to scale back their offerings or elect not to renew their agreements, cause prospective students not to enroll or existing students to not stay enrolled in our offerings, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective clients or students. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover losses associated with such events, and in any case, such insurance may not cover all costs, expenses or losses we could incur to respond to and remediate a security breach. As a result,\nwe may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches.\nData protection laws in jurisdictions around the world require companies and institutions to notify impacted individuals of data breach incidents, usually in writing. Under the terms of our contracts with our university clients, we would be responsible for the costs of investigating and disclosing data breaches to the university clients\u2019 students, if required by law. In addition to costs associated with investigating and fully disclosing a data breach, we could be subject to substantial monetary fines or private claims by affected parties and our reputation would likely be harmed.\nDisruption to or failures of our platform could reduce university client and student satisfaction with our offerings and could harm our reputation.\nThe performance and reliability of our platform is critical to our operations, reputation and ability to attract new university clients, as well as our student acquisition and retention efforts. Our university clients rely on our platform to provide their offerings online, and students access our platform on a frequent basis as an important part of their educational experience. Because our platform is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our platform may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our university clients and students. Web- and mobile- based applications frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, and we have from time to time found errors and defects in our technology and new errors and defects may be detected in the future. In addition, we have experienced and may in the future experience temporary system interruptions to our platform for a variety of reasons, including network failures, power failures, problems with third-party firmware and software updates, as well as an overwhelming number of users trying to access our platform. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our platform could damage our or our university clients\u2019 reputations, decrease student satisfaction and retention and impact our ability to attract new students and university clients. If any of these problems occur, our university clients could attempt to terminate their agreements with us or make indemnification or other claims against us. In addition, sustained or recurring disruptions in our platform could adversely affect our and our university clients\u2019 compliance with applicable regulations and accrediting body standards.\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to host certain aspects of our platform and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could impair our ability to deliver our platform to clients and students, resulting in client and student dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.\nOur online learning platform and certain of our other technology and services are hosted on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services, or AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of, or interference with our use of, AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. AWS may terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days\u2019 notice. Additionally, AWS has the right to terminate the agreement immediately with notice to us in certain scenarios, such as if AWS believes providing the services could create a substantial economic or technical burden or material security risk for AWS, or in order to comply with the law or requests of governmental entities. If any of our arrangements with AWS is terminated, we could experience interruptions in our platform as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services.\nOur operations depend, in part, on AWS\u2019s abilities to protect their data center hosting facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. The occurrence of spikes in usage volume, a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close a facility without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our platform, which would result in harm to our business. In the event of a system failure, the backup systems and disaster recovery services provided by AWS may be insufficient or fail. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability or cause our clients to fail to renew or terminate their contracts, any of which could harm our business.\nOur internal information technology systems are critical to our business. System integration and implementation issues could disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business or result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, including systems for billing, human resources, enterprise resource planning, and customer relationship management. As our business has grown in size and complexity, the growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our internal information technology systems. To effectively manage this growth, we must commit significant financial resources and personnel to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop or acquire new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in our business and information-processing technology as well as evolving industry, regulatory, and accounting standards. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is determined to be inaccurate or unreliable, or if we fail to properly maintain or enhance our internal information technology systems, we could have operational disruptions, significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses in our internal controls, incur increased operating and administrative expenses, lose our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or suffer other adverse consequences\nIf the mobile solutions available to our students and clients are not effective, the use of our platform could decline.\nStudents have been increasingly accessing our offerings and marketplace on mobile devices through our mobile applications in recent years. The smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or our clients may believe that online learning through such mobile devices is not effective. If we are not able to provide our clients with the functionality to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, our ability to attract students to our offerings may be harmed and, consequently, our business may suffer.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile features are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them. In addition, supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources.\nThe success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control, such as:\n\u2022actions taken by mobile app distributors;\n\u2022unfavorable treatment received by our mobile apps, especially as compared to competing apps, such as the placement of our mobile apps in a mobile app download store;\n\u2022increased costs in the distribution and use of our mobile apps; or\n\u2022changes in mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, that degrade functionality of our mobile website or mobile apps or that give preferential treatment to competitive offerings.\nIf our clients or students encounter difficulty accessing or using, or if they choose not to use, our mobile platform, our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, the success of our business model will be compromised.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in a relatively short period of time, which has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and may require us to expand personnel on certain teams, as well as our facilities and infrastructure. We will also be required to refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to manage the growth of our business efficiently, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may not successfully expand our university client base, enhance our platform, develop new offerings with new and existing university clients, attract a sufficient number of students in a cost-effective manner, satisfy the requirements of our existing university clients, respond to competitive challenges or otherwise execute our business plan. Accordingly, our historical revenue growth rate may not continue in the future.\nOur ability to manage any significant growth of our business effectively will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022effectively recruit, integrate, train and motivate any new employees, while retaining existing employees;\n\u2022maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture and effectively execute our business plan;\n\u2022implement systems enhancements and continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls;\n\u2022protect and further develop our strategic assets, including our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022make sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company.\nThese activities will require significant capital expenditures and place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage any future growth in a cost-effective or timely manner, or at all, which could negatively affect the quality of our platform, our reputation, results of operations and overall business.\nWe may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies or technologies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our shareholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nWe have in the past acquired and may in the future acquire complementary products, services, technologies or businesses. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to complete these transactions may be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control. In addition, we may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets, may incorrectly estimate the value of an acquisition target or may not be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close.\nAn acquisition, investment, or new business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties, expenditures and integration challenges including the following:\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance;\n\u2022managing a larger combined company;\n\u2022maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u2022retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n\u2022consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations and inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;\n\u2022undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third party\u2019s code in the products of the acquired companies or in the technology acquired;\n\u2022breaches of our cybersecurity measures if there are cybersecurity issues we are not aware of at the time of the acquisition;\n\u2022entry into highly competitive markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022exposure to unknown liabilities, including claims and disputes by third parties against the companies we acquire.\nMany of these factors will be outside of the combined company\u2019s control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreased revenue and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we experience difficulties with the integration process following an acquisition, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized.\nIn addition, in connection with an acquisition, investment or new business relationship we may:\n\u2022issue additional equity securities that would dilute current shareholders;\n\u2022use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay or that may place burdensome restrictions on our operations;\n\u2022incur large charges or substantial liabilities; or\n\u2022become subject to adverse tax consequences.\nAny of these outcomes could harm our business and operating results. In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we have acquired and may acquire in the future may be allocated to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. If our acquisitions do not ultimately yield expected returns, we may be required to make changes to our operating results based on our impairment assessment process. For example, an interim goodwill impairment test performed in 2019 indicated that the carrying value of Trilogy exceeded its fair value. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $70.4 million on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill balance was $834.5 million and indefinite-lived intangible asset was $255.0 million, a significant portion of which relate to the edX Acquisition.\nWe face competition from established and emerging companies, which could divert clients or students to our competitors, result in pricing pressure and significantly reduce our revenue.\nWe expect that the online learning market will continue to expand and that the number of degree and non-degree offerings available online will proliferate.\nParticularly in the Degree Program Segment, the number of new competitive entrants into the online learning market has expanded rapidly in recent years. As the number of online degree programs expands, we face increasing competition to enroll students in our offerings. This expansion has also resulted in an increase in the number of regional online degree program offerings for potential students. In addition to making enrollment decisions based on factors such as program quality and university brand strength, we have observed potential students giving preference to universities located in their region, which has further impacted the competitive landscape in our Degree Program Segment.\nIn our Alternative Credential Segment, which has a lower barrier to entry, we face increasing competition from other providers of massive open online courses, which directly compete with our open course offerings, but have also expanded their offerings to include certificate offerings, nano-degrees and similar non-degree alternatives. We also face competition from companies that provide corporate training programs and online courses taught outside the university environment (e.g., by experts in various fields). Many of these competitors can also leverage the strength of their consumer facing brands to attract students to their offerings at a low cost.\nWe expect existing competitors and new entrants to the online learning market to revise and improve their business models constantly in response to challenges from competing businesses, including ours. If these or other market participants introduce new or improved delivery of online education and technology-enabled services that we cannot match or exceed in a timely or cost-effective manner, our ability to grow our revenue and achieve profitability could be compromised.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. Increased competition may result in pricing pressure for us in terms of the percentage of tuition and fees we are able to negotiate to receive. The competitive landscape may also result in longer and more complex sales cycles with a prospective university client or a decrease in our market share among select nonprofit colleges and universities seeking to offer online educational offerings, any of which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nA number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential client and student opportunities or force us to offer our platform on less favorable economic terms, including:\n\u2022competitors may develop service offerings that our potential clients or students find to be more compelling than ours;\n\u2022competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive sales terms, adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in client and student requirements, and devote greater resources to the acquisition of students than we can;\n\u2022current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and expand their markets, and our industry is likely to see an increasing number of new entrants and increased consolidation. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share; and\n\u2022colleges and universities may choose to continue using or to develop their own online learning solutions in-house, rather than pay for our platform.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. In addition, competition may intensify as our competitors raise additional capital and as established companies in other market segments or geographic markets expand into our market segments or geographic markets. If we cannot compete successfully against our competitors, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability could be impaired.\nIf for-profit postsecondary institutions, which offer online education alternatives different from ours, or online program management providers perform poorly or continue to attract negative publicity, it could tarnish the reputation of online education as a whole, which could impair our ability to grow our business.\nFor-profit postsecondary institutions, many of which provide course offerings predominantly online, remain under intense regulatory and other scrutiny, which has led to media attention that has portrayed that sector in an unflattering light. Some for-profit online school operators have been subject to governmental investigations alleging the misuse of public funds, financial irregularities, exaggerated promises to students, and failure to achieve positive outcomes for students, including the inability to obtain employment in their fields. These allegations have attracted significant adverse media coverage and have prompted ongoing legislative hearings and actions as well as regulatory responses at both the state and federal level. These investigations have focused on specific companies and individuals, and the entire industry in the case of marketing and recruiting practices by for-profit higher education companies. Even though we do not market our platform to for-profit institutions, and have a different business model from them, this negative media attention may nevertheless foster skepticism about online higher education generally and our company specifically. Allegations of abuse of federal financial aid funds and other statutory violations against for-profit higher education companies, even if unfounded, could negatively impact our opportunity to succeed due to increased regulation or decreased demand for our offerings. Our company has been the subject of articles and inquiries by critics of for-profit education models generally, and such critics have advocated for changes in law and regulation at the state and federal level that would be adverse to our business model and have sought information and increased oversight regarding the business practices of online program management companies. Such critics have sometimes compared our business to that of entities that were formally for-profit institutions and that subsequently converted to non-profit status, and the conflation of these newer business models with our own may increase scrutiny of our business by Congress, DOE or other regulatory agencies. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to increase our university client base and grow our offerings and our revenue, which would make it difficult to continue to grow our business.\nIf we do not retain our senior management team and key employees, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management team. In this respect, our senior management team is heavily involved in the university client identification and sales process, and their expertise is critical in navigating the complex approval processes of large nonprofit colleges and universities. We do not maintain key-person insurance on any of our employees, including our senior management team. The loss of the services of any individual on our senior management team, or failure to find a suitable successor, could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals.\nOur future success also depends heavily on the retention of our marketing and sales, technology and content development and support teams to continue to attract and retain students, thereby generating revenue for us. In particular, our highly-skilled technology and content development employees provide the technical expertise underlying our technology and technology-enabled services that support our university clients\u2019 offerings and the students enrolled in these offerings. We have experienced intense competition for these employees, and we may be unable to attract or retain these key personnel that are critical to our success, resulting in harm to our relationships with university clients, loss of expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.\nIn addition, as a result of business acquisitions, current and prospective employees of 2U and any acquired company may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the acquisition. If our employees or the employees of any acquired company depart because of issues relating to uncertainty or perceived difficulties of integration, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could be adversely impacted.\nWe maintain offices outside of the United States, have international residents that apply to and enroll in our offerings and plan to expand our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations.\nSince 2017, and more recently as a result of the edX Acquisition, we have significantly increased our international operations, including the number of international applicants and students in our offerings. One element of our growth strategy is to continue expanding our international operations and to continue expanding our global student and client base. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks that could constrain our operations and compromise our growth prospects, including:\n\u2022the need to localize and adapt online offerings for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and ensuring that these offerings enable our university clients to comply with local education laws and regulations;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including different pricing environments, longer sales cycles, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022lack of familiarity with and unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition, and practices which may favor local competitors;\n\u2022weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including labor and employment, tax, education, privacy and data protection, and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act;\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022adverse tax consequences, including liabilities for indirect taxes or the potential for required withholding taxes for our overseas employees;\n\u2022terrorist attacks, public health crises, acts of violence or war and adverse environmental conditions;\n\u2022a country\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic or economic and political measures taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 as well as any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022unstable regional, economic or political conditions; and\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates or restrictions on foreign currency and resulting effects on our revenue and expenses.\nOur expansion efforts may not be successful. Our experience with attracting university clients and students in the U.S. may not be relevant to our ability to attract clients and students in other markets. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to attract university clients and students successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nOur operations in South Africa expose us to risks that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have a significant employee base in South Africa. We may incur costs complying with labor laws, rules and regulations in South Africa, including laws that regulate work time, provide for mandatory compensation in the event of termination of employment for operational reasons, and impose monetary penalties for non-compliance with administrative and reporting requirements in respect of affirmative action policies. Our reliance on a workforce in South Africa also exposes us to disruptions in the business, political, and economic environment in that region, as well as natural disasters, public health crises and other environmental conditions. Maintenance of a stable political environment is important to our operations in South Africa, and terrorist attacks and acts of violence or war may directly affect our physical facilities and workforce or contribute to general instability. Our operations in South Africa require us to comply with complex local laws and regulatory requirements and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The economy of South Africa in the past has been, and in the future may continue to be, characterized by rates of inflation and interest rates that are substantially higher than those prevailing in the United States, which could increase our South-African-based costs and decrease our operating margins. Our operations in South Africa may also subject us to trade restrictions, exchange control limitations, reduced or inadequate protection for intellectual property rights, security breaches, and other factors that may adversely affect our business. Negative developments in any of these areas could increase our costs of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nWe engage some individuals classified as independent contractors, not employees, and if U.S. or international regulatory authorities mandate that they be classified as employees, our business would be adversely impacted.\nWe engage independent contractors and are subject to U.S. and international regulations and guidelines regarding independent contractor classification. These regulations and guidelines are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it could be determined that our current or former independent contractor classifications are inapplicable. Further, if legal standards for classification of independent contractors change, it may be necessary to modify our compensation structure for these personnel, including by paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses. In addition, if our independent contractors are determined to have been misclassified as independent contractors, we would incur additional exposure under U.S. and international law, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Any of these outcomes could result in\nsubstantial costs to us, could significantly impair our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business as we choose, and could damage our reputation and our ability to attract and retain other personnel.\nWe rely on certain third-party providers of software and services integral to the operations of our business.\nWe rely on software that we license from third parties and services provided by third parties to offer certain components of our technology and services. In addition, we may need to obtain future licenses or services from third parties necessary for the continued provision of our technology and services, which might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If our agreements with third-party software or services vendors are not renewed or the third-party software or services become obsolete, fail to function properly, are defective or otherwise fail to provide quality service or address our or our clients\u2019 needs, there is no assurance that we would be able to replace the functionality provided by the third-party software or service provider with software or services from alternative providers. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the edX Acquisition and the Combined Company\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of edX into our business and in realizing the expected benefits of the edX Acquisition.\nThe success of the edX Acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities from combining the operations of edX with our business in an efficient and effective manner. Following the closing of the edX Acquisition, we are integrating the edX business with our existing business, which is a complex and time-consuming process. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of edX or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the edX Acquisition, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair our operations. It is possible that this integration and our efforts to realize the expected benefits of the edX Acquisition could result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n\u2022the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, including as a result of diverting management\u2019s attention to integration efforts;\n\u2022unanticipated issues in integrating operations and systems, including administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems;\n\u2022the burden of complying with a wide variety of laws, including additional privacy, marketing and international trade and economic sanctions related laws, some of which did not apply to edX as a non-profit before the closing of the edX Acquisition;\n\u2022managing a larger combined company;\n\u2022maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;\n\u2022maintaining the reputation and brand of edX, including as a result of the edX business ceasing to be operated by a non-profit entity;\n\u2022the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process or expected synergies;\n\u2022inability to realize the expected operating leverage, marketing efficiencies and other strategic benefits anticipated\n\u2022inability to maintain and grow the edX enterprise business;\n\u2022coordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022tax costs, liabilities or inefficiencies;\n\u2022additional regulatory scrutiny focused on edX or the combined company; and\n\u2022unforeseen expenses associated with the integration of the edX business.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the edX Acquisition and could harm our financial performance. The initial anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits of the edX Acquisition assume a successful integration of edX\u2019s operations and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of edX with our business, we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits resulting from the edX Acquisition, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Even if integration is successful,\nanticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits may not be achieved. If, among other things, we are unable to achieve the anticipated strategic benefits or synergies, or if the integration costs related to the edX Acquisition are greater than expected, the market price of our common stock may decline. The market price of our common stock also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the edX Acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the edX Acquisition on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nWe have incurred substantial transaction and integration expenses related to the edX Acquisition and expect to incur additional integration expenses related to edX that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the edX Acquisition and associated integration activities. For example, we expect to incur costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. Any expected efficiencies to offset these costs may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nWe do not control and may be unable to predict the future path of the Licensed edX Platform.\nCertain of our offerings are hosted on the open source learner management platform that is owned by the non-profit entity that survived the edX Acquisition (the \u201cLicensed Platform\u201d). We do not own the Licensed Platform and we do not control and may be unable to predict the future path of open source technology development of the Licensed Platform, including the ongoing development of open source components used in the Licensed Platform, which could reduce the appeal of our offerings hosted on the Licensed Platform and damage our reputation. If open source software programmers, many of whom we do not employ, or our own internal programmers do not continue to develop and enhance the Licensed Platform, we may be unable to meet student or university requirements.\nIf students do not expand beyond the free offerings available on our platform, our ability to grow our business and improve our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMany of our students initially access the free or audit track of the open courses available on our platform. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to persuade those students to enroll in the paid certificate track of the open courses available on our platform or in one of our other degree programs, executive education programs, boot camps or micro-credential courses. If students do not expand beyond free offerings, our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capital Structure\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $960.3 million of indebtedness on a consolidated basis. See Note 9 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022require a substantial portion of our cash from operating activities to be dedicated to debt service payments and reduce the amount of cash available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors who have less debt;\n\u2022hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to secure adequate bank financing in the future with reasonable terms and conditions; and\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to, and limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses.\nThe Indenture and the Term Loan Agreement contain, and the agreements governing indebtedness we may incur in the future may contain, affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nIn addition, we may need to amend agreements that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. On March 5, 2021, the authority that regulates LIBOR announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of one, three- and six-month LIBOR after June 30, 2023. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating such LIBOR periods will be established such that they continue to exist after June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has recommended replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR periods with a newly created term index based on the secured overnight financing rate, commonly referred to as \u2018Term SOFR\u2019; provided, that, our Term Loan Agreement, after the cessation of such LIBOR periods, shall use firstly \u2018Term SOFR\u2019 plus a customary market adjustment and if Term SOFR is no longer available, overnight SOFR plus a customary market adjustment. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and existing restrictive covenants, we may still incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future under the agreements governing our indebtedness. We will not be restricted under the terms of the Indenture from incurring additional debt. Although the Term Loan Agreement contains, and any future indebtedness may contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions could permit us to incur obligations that, although preferential to our common stock in terms of payment, do not constitute indebtedness.\nFurthermore, any future indebtedness may prohibit or otherwise restrict us from making any cash payments on the conversion or repurchase of the Notes. Our failure to make cash payments upon the conversion or repurchase of the Notes as required under the terms of the Notes would permit holders of the Notes to accelerate our obligations under the Notes. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with such covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains a financial covenant that may limit our operational flexibility.\nIn connection with the edX Acquisition, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement, which requires us to comply with several customary financial and other restrictive covenants, such as maintaining leverage ratios in certain situations, maintaining insurance coverage, and restricting our ability to make certain investments. We are also required to maintain minimum Recurring Revenues (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Company commencing with fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021 through the Maturity Date (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), which may limit our ability to engage in new lines of business, make certain investments, pay dividends, or enter into various transactions.\nThis covenant may limit the flexibility of our operations, and failure to meet this financial covenant could result in a default under the Term Loan Agreement. If such a default were to occur, the lenders would have the right to terminate their commitments to provide loans under the Term Loan Agreement and declare any and all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral in which we granted a first priority security interest to them, which consists of substantially all our assets. If the debt under the Term Loan Agreement were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operating activities or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or amounts paid upon conversion of the Notes, or if we fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness and we are unable to obtain waivers from the required lenders or noteholders, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nHolders of the Notes may, subject to certain exceptions, require us to repurchase their Notes following a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion, we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the Notes.\nConversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon any conversion of the Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. The anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could also depress the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in the Notes, Indenture and in the Term Loan Agreement could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.\nCertain provisions in the Notes and the Indenture could make a third-party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture), then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the Indenture, as well as the Term Loan Agreement, under which a \u201cchange of control\u201d is an event of default resulting in acceleration of all indebtedness thereunder, could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contract on an Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d), which amends the accounting standards for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion. ASU 2020-06 eliminates requirements to separately account for liability and equity components of such convertible debt instruments and eliminates the ability to use the treasury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Instead, ASU 2020-06 requires (i) the entire amount of the security to be presented as a liability on the balance sheet and (ii) application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share will generally be calculated assuming that all the Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive, which could adversely affect our diluted earnings per share. However, if the principal amount of the convertible debt security being converted is required to be paid in cash and only the excess is permitted to be settled in shares, the if-converted method will produce a similar result as the treasury stock method prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 for such convertible debt security.\nWe will adopt ASU 2020-06 in the first quarter of 2022, using the modified retrospective basis, effective as of January 1, 2022. Following adoption of this ASU, we will no longer separate the liability and equity components of the Notes on our balance sheet.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash\npayments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nThe option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions from time to time (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the Notes, any repurchase of the Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the Notes are retired by us, in each case, if we exercise our option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if any such capped call transactions are terminated for any reason, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may unwind their hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nFurthermore, the option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of a number of financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nWe might not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2029. Our gross state net operating loss carryforwards are equal to or less than the federal net operating loss carryforwards and expire over various periods based on individual state tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, we determined that such an ownership change occurred. Absent a subsequent ownership change, however, all of our historical net operating losses should be available. Therefore, the occurrence of the ownership change during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 is not expected to limit our ability to carry forward historical net operating losses before expiration. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. If a future ownership change occurs and limits our ability to use our historical net operating loss carryforwards, it would harm our future financial statement results by increasing our future tax obligations. We also have net operating loss carryforwards in South Africa and the United Kingdom and there is no guarantee that entities in these countries will generate enough taxable income to fully utilize them.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise our ability to grow our business.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, accelerate our growth, develop new offerings or enhance our platform. Our continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing and our operating performance, all of which may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we seek to raise additional capital, it may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all. In addition, under our Term Loan Agreement, we may be restricted from using the net proceeds of financing transactions for our operating objectives. Lack of sufficient capital resources could significantly limit our ability to manage our business and to take advantage of business and strategic opportunities. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or debt securities with an equity component would dilute our stock ownership. If adequate additional funds are not available if and when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate material parts of our business strategy.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Business and That of Our University Clients\nOur business model relies on university client institutions complying with federal and state laws and regulations.\nHigher education is heavily regulated. All of our university clients in the United States and certain university clients outside of the United States participate in Title IV federal student financial assistance programs under the HEA of 1965, as amended, or HEA, and are subject to extensive regulation by the DOE, as well as various state agencies, licensing boards and accrediting commissions. To participate in the Title IV programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE, and be certified by the DOE as an eligible institution. If a university client participating in Title IV was found to be in non-compliance with any of these laws, regulations, standards or policies, the university client could lose some or all of its access to Title IV program funds, lose the ability to offer certain programs or lose its ability to operate in certain states, any of which could cause our revenue from that university client\u2019s program to decline.\nThe regulations, standards and policies applicable to our university clients change frequently and are often subject to interpretation. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations or standards could compromise our university clients\u2019 accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities or use of federal funds under Title IV programs. We cannot predict with certainty how the requirements applied by our university clients\u2019 regulators will be interpreted, or whether our university clients will be able to comply with these requirements in the future.\nCertain requirements of Title II and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act apply to us and our university clients and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 applies to our university clients that receive federal funding. Further, in the absence of definitive federal rulemaking, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, a set of recommendations and technical standards for making websites accessible to individuals with disabilities published by the World Wide Web Consortium, have become the effective standard for learner-facing aspects of our platform. We may not be successful in ensuring that our offerings and services comply with these changing statutory and regulatory requirements, which could make our solutions less attractive to our clients and students, and we expect to incur ongoing costs of compliance.\nOur activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations and other requirements.\nAlthough we are not an institution of higher education, we are required to comply with certain education laws and regulations as a result of our role as a service provider to higher education institutions, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with university clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in breach of contract and indemnification claims and could cause damage to our reputation and impair our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability.\nActivities of the U.S. Congress or Department of Education could result in adverse legislation or regulatory actions or investigations.\nThe process of reauthorization of the HEA began in 2014 and is expected to continue until the HEA is updated. Congressional hearings will continue to be scheduled by the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce and other Congressional committees regarding various aspects of the education industry, including accreditation matters, student debt, student recruiting, cost of tuition, distance learning, competency-based learning, student success and outcomes and other matters. Future hearings may include a discussion of the role of online program management companies.\nThe increased scrutiny and results-based accountability initiatives in the education sector, as well as ongoing policy differences in Congress regarding spending levels and other issues, could lead to significant changes in connection with the reauthorization of the HEA or otherwise. These changes may place new or additional regulatory burdens on postsecondary schools generally, and specific initiatives may be targeted at or have an impact upon companies like us that serve higher education. The adoption of any laws or regulations that limit our ability to provide our services to our university clients could compromise our ability to drive revenue through their programs or make our platform less attractive to them. Congress could also enact laws or authorize regulations that require us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our costs, including as a result of new regulatory burdens.\nIn addition, regulatory activities and initiatives of the DOE may have similar consequences for our business even in the absence of Congressional action. For example, DOE initiated two new rulemaking processes in 2021 that may impact our partners. While neither proceeding is expected to directly impact our business model, we cannot predict the impact that these and other, future DOE initiatives may have on us, our reputation or operating results.\nOur business model, which depends on our ability to receive a share of tuition revenue as payment from our university clients, has been validated by a DOE \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter, but such validation is not codified by statute or regulation and may be subject to change.\nEach institution that participates in Title IV programs agrees it will not \u201cprovide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to\nany person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV, HEA program funds.\u201d Virtually all of our university clients participate in Title IV Programs.\nAlthough this rule, referred to as the incentive compensation rule, generally prohibits entities or individuals from receiving incentive-based compensation payments for the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students, the DOE provided official policy guidance in 2011 permitting tuition revenue-sharing arrangements known as the \u201cbundled services rule.\u201d Our current business model relies in part on the bundled services rule to enter into tuition revenue-sharing agreements with our university clients.\nBecause the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by the DOE in the form of a \u201cdear colleague\u201d letter, or DCL, and is not codified by statute or regulation, there is risk that the rule could be altered or removed without customary administrative procedural requirements, such as adequate prior notice, that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Although the DCL remains the longstanding policy of the DOE, the bundled services rule could be reviewed, altered or vacated in the future. In addition, the legal weight the DCL would carry in litigation over the propriety of any specific compensation arrangements under the HEA or the incentive compensation rule is uncertain. We can offer no assurances as to how the DCL would be interpreted by a court. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, the DOE or a court, whether in an action involving our company or our university clients, or in action that does not involve us, could require us to change our business model and renegotiate the terms of many of our university client contracts and could compromise our ability to generate revenue.\nIf we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our university clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities.\nEven though the DCL clarifies that tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with our university clients are permissible, we are still subject to other provisions of the incentive compensation rule that prohibit us from offering to our employees who are involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful identification, admission or enrollment of students into any institution. If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our university clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities, including liabilities related to \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claims under the federal False Claims Act. Any such claims, even if without merit, could require us to incur significant costs to defend the claim, distract management\u2019s attention and damage our reputation.\nIf we or our subcontractors or agents violate the misrepresentation rule, or similar federal and state regulatory requirements, we could face fines, sanctions and other liabilities.\nWe are required to comply with other regulations promulgated by the DOE that affect our student acquisition activities, including the misrepresentation rule. The misrepresentation rule is broad in scope and applies to statements our employees, subcontractors or agents may make about the nature of a university client\u2019s program, a university client\u2019s financial charges or the employability of a university client\u2019s program graduates. A violation of this rule, FTC rules or other federal or state regulations applicable to our marketing activities by an employee, subcontractor or agent performing services for university clients could lead to governmental investigations and sanctions, hurt our reputation, result in the termination of university client contracts, require us to pay fines or other monetary penalties or require us to pay the costs associated with indemnifying a university client from private claims or government investigations.\nIf our university clients fail to maintain their state authorizations, or we or our university clients violate other state laws and regulations, students in their offerings could be adversely affected and we could lose our ability to operate in that state and provide services to these university clients.\nOur university clients must be authorized in certain states to offer online educational offerings, engage in recruiting and operate externships, internships, clinical training or other forms of field experience, depending on state law. The loss of or failure to obtain state authorization would, among other things, limit the ability of a university client to enroll students in that state, render the university client and its students ineligible to participate in Title IV programs in that state, diminish the attractiveness of the university client\u2019s offering and ultimately compromise our ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nIn addition, if we or any of our university clients fail to comply with any state agency\u2019s rules, regulations or standards beyond authorizations, the state agency or state attorney general could limit the ability of the university client to offer educational offerings in that state or limit our ability to perform our contractual obligations to our university client in that state.\nIf our university clients fail to maintain institutional or programmatic accreditation for their offerings, our revenue could be materially affected.\nThe loss or suspension of a university client\u2019s accreditation or other adverse action by the university client\u2019s institutional or programmatic accreditor would render the institution or its offerings ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, could prevent the university client from offering certain educational offerings and, for certain degree-granting programs, could make it impossible for the graduates of the university client\u2019s program to obtain employment in the profession for which they trained. If any of these results occurs, it could hurt our ability to generate revenue from that offering.\nOur future growth could be impaired if our university clients fail to obtain timely approval from applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs, make substantive changes to existing programs or expand their programs into or within certain states.\nOur university clients are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from the DOE and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies for new programs or locations, which may be conditioned, delayed or denied in a manner that could impair our strategic plans and future growth. Regulatory constraints have resulted in delays to various approvals our university clients are requesting, and such delays could in turn delay the timing of our ability to generate revenue from our university clients\u2019 programs.\nIf more state agencies require specialized approval of our university clients\u2019 offerings, our operating costs could increase significantly, approval times could lag, or we could be prohibited from operating in certain states.\nIn addition to state licensing agencies, our university clients may be required to obtain approval from professional licensing boards in certain states to offer specialized programs in specific fields of study. Currently, relatively few states require institutions to obtain professional board approval for their online educational offerings. However, more states could pass laws requiring our university clients\u2019 offerings, such as graduate programs in teaching or nursing, to obtain approval from state professional boards. If a significant number of states pass additional laws requiring schools to obtain professional board approval, the cost of obtaining all necessary state approvals could dramatically increase, which could make our platform less attractive to university clients, and these university clients could be barred from operating in some states entirely.\nEvolving regulations and legal obligations related to data privacy, data protection and information security and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data security is rapidly evolving and likely is to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In providing our platform to university clients and in operating our business, we collect and process regulated personal information from students, faculty, prospective students and employees. Our handling of this personal information is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, which have been adopted by federal, state and foreign governments to regulate the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these privacy laws and regulations or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of this personal information in our possession, could result in government enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nVarious federal, state and foreign legislative, regulatory or other governmental bodies have adopted laws or regulations concerning privacy, security, data storage and data protection that could materially adversely impact our business. Moreover, much of the personal information we collect and process is regulated by multiple privacy laws across various jurisdictions. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018, introduced robust new requirements for the protection of personal data of individuals in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and substantial fines for non-compliance, including fines up to 4% of a Company\u2019s annual global revenue. However, with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) from the EU in 2020, we must also now comply with the local laws of that jurisdiction such as the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation. This introduces the risk of possible enforcement from a separate data protection authority, with its distinct power to impose substantial fines for non-compliance. As another example, in July 2020, South Africa\u2019s privacy law known as the Protection of Personal Information Act became effective, mandating new requirements for processing of personal information by entities domiciled in South Africa, and our Company must comply with these laws.\nWe are also subject to evolving EU rules on data transfer, as we may transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other jurisdictions. The invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework in July 2020 and introduction of updated Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) in 2021 for alternative means of cross-border data transfer, introduces additional complexity and risk to our compliance measures.\nIn the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) took effect in January 2020. Pursuant to the CCPA, we are required, among other things, to meet certain enhanced notice requirements to California residents regarding our use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal\ninformation without penalty, and provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from Californians in the event of certain data breaches.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, rulings and industry standards concerning privacy, security, data storage and data protection in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations, rulings and standards may have on our business. For example, the European ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC), which obliges EU member states to introduce certain national laws regulating privacy in the electronic communications sector, will soon be replaced by the ePrivacy Regulation. As the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development and in draft form, and as further guidance is issued and interpretations of both the ePrivacy Regulation and the GDPR develop, it is difficult to assess the impact of either on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data practices and policies. In addition, in 2021 new privacy laws were passed in China, Brazil and other jurisdictions, and many countries are considering updates to their current data protection regulations, including Australia and India.\nIn the U.S., various states have proposed privacy laws that represent a trend towards stronger privacy protections and greater data transparency. In January 2023, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which includes significant amendments to the CCPA, becomes operative, thereby placing additional obligations on us to protect personal information, to offer enhanced data rights to Californians, and to provide notice regarding our data sharing practices. Likewise, both Colorado and Virginia passed consumer privacy laws in 2021. Without an overarching federal law driving privacy compliance in the U.S., the risk is high of a patchwork of privacy legislation formed by individual state laws, similar to the states\u2019 approach to breach notification obligations. This could not only increase costs for compliance but also raise the risk of enforcement by individual state attorneys general.\nComplying with these and other changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs, or require us to change our business practices, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are required to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, and failure to do so could harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nFERPA generally prohibits an institution of higher education participating in Title IV programs from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student\u2019s education records without the student\u2019s consent. Our university clients and their students disclose to us certain information that originates from or comprises a student education record under FERPA. As an entity that provides services to institutions participating in Title IV programs, we are indirectly subject to FERPA, and we may not transfer or otherwise disclose any personally identifiable information from a student record to another party other than in a manner permitted under the statute. If we violate FERPA, it could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our university clients and could harm our reputation. Further, in the event that we disclose student information in violation of FERPA, the DOE could require a university client to suspend our access to its student information for at least five years.\nIn our Alternative Credential Segment, we are subject to risks and compliance rules and regulations related to the third-party credit card payment processing platform integrated within our websites or otherwise used by our business.\nStudents typically use a credit or debit card to pay application and enrollment fees and to make tuition payments for the offerings in our Alternative Credential Segment that are not free. We are subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. We believe that we and the payment processing service providers we use are compliant in all material respects with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. However, there is no guarantee that such compliance will be maintained or that compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our systems that are integrated with our payment processing providers. If we or any of the third-party payment processors we use fail to be in compliance with applicable credit card rules and regulations, we may be required to migrate to an alternate payment processor which could result in transaction downtime during the migration and/or a loss of students and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental export, import and sanctions controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export and similar laws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of certain services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons, and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have\nenacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to provide students access to our platform or could limit our students\u2019 ability to access or use our services in those countries.\nChanges in our platform, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our international students from utilizing our platform or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation or changes in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform to, existing or potential students internationally. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial results.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation. Claims of infringement against us may hurt our business.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to avoid infringing intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement without major financial expenditures or adverse consequences. The technology and software fields generally are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and many companies that own, or claim to own, intellectual property have aggressively asserted their rights. In addition, we face potential copyright and trademark infringement from the content we produce in connection with our marketing activities, including in websites related to our offerings. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business. In addition, our university client agreements require us to indemnify our university clients against claims that our platform infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nFuture litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves or our university clients from intellectual property infringement claims or to establish our proprietary rights. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and would be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have any merit, these claims are time-consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could:\n\u2022hurt our reputation;\n\u2022adversely affect our relationships with our current or future university clients;\n\u2022cause delays or stoppages in providing our platform;\n\u2022divert management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u2022require technology changes to our software that could cause us to incur substantial cost;\n\u2022subject us to significant liabilities; and\n\u2022require us to cease some or all of our activities.\nIn addition to liability for monetary damages against us, which may include attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages in the event of a finding of willful infringement, or, in some circumstances, damages against our university clients, we may be prohibited from developing, commercializing or continuing to provide some or all of our bundled technology-enabled platform unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all.\nWe may incur liability, or our reputation may be harmed, as a result of the activities of our university clients and students or the content in our online learning platforms.\nWe may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our university clients or students in connection with the data they post or store in our online learning platforms. For example, university personnel or students, or our employees or independent contractors, may post to our online learning platforms various articles or other third-party content for use in class discussions or within asynchronous lessons.\nVarious U.S. federal statutes may apply to us with respect to these activities. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, or DMCA and the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, have provisions that limit our liability for certain content posted by third parties on our platforms.\nAlthough statutes and case law in the U.S. have generally shielded us from liability for these activities to date, court rulings in pending or future litigation may narrow the scope of protection afforded us under these laws. In addition, laws governing these activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, distribution or other use of third-party content. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our uses of such material, which may include changing or removing content from courses or altering the functionality of our online learning platform, or to pay monetary damages.\nAdditionally, university personnel or students, or our employees or independent contractors could use our online learning platform to store or process regulated personal information without our knowledge. In the event that our systems experience a data security incident, or an individual or entity accesses information without, or in excess of, proper authorization, we could be subject to data security incident notification laws, as described elsewhere, which may require prompt remediation and notification to individuals. If we are unaware of the data and information stored on our systems, we may be unable to appropriately comply with all legal obligations, and we may be exposed to governmental enforcement or prosecution actions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and these incidents could harm our reputation and business.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our platform, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as critical to our success. We protect our proprietary information from unauthorized use and disclosure by entering into confidentiality agreements with any party that may come in contact with such information. We also seek to ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies and any other third party that may create intellectual property for us that assigns any copyright and patent rights to us. However, these arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nWe pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in jurisdictions outside the United States. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe on our trademark or service mark rights, third parties may challenge our trademark or service mark rights, and pending or future trademark or service mark applications may not be approved. In addition, effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate. In any or all cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense to prevent infringement or enforce our rights.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. In addition, the laws of many countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Further, the laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property rights. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our platform. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate litigation such as infringement or administrative proceedings, to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights.\nThe use of \u201copen source\u201d software in our platform could negatively affect our ability to offer our platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nA portion of our platform incorporates so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Certain open source licenses may, in certain circumstances, require us to offer our platform that incorporates the open source software for no cost, to make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and to license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Our efforts to monitor the use of open source software in our platform to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose our source code when we do not wish to do so, may be unable to prevent such use from occurring. In addition, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party without our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to comply with the foregoing conditions. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software that we use were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be\nrequired to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, including being enjoined from offering the component of our platform that contained the open source software and being required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt our ability to offer certain components of our platform.\nWe could also be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. Accordingly, there is a risk that those licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to offer our platform. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products.\nIndividuals that appear in content hosted on our online learning platform may claim violation of their rights.\nFaculty and students that appear in video segments hosted on our online learning platform may claim that proper assignments, licenses, consents and releases were not obtained for use of their likenesses, images or other contributed content. Our contracts typically require that our university clients ensure that proper assignments, licenses, consents and releases are obtained for their course material, but we cannot know with certainty that they have obtained all necessary rights. Moreover, the laws governing rights of publicity and privacy, and the laws governing faculty ownership of course content, are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, such that the enforcement of agreements to transfer the necessary rights is unclear. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, display, distribution or other use of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our use of such material, which may include changing or removing content from courses, or to pay monetary damages. Moreover, claims by faculty and students could damage our reputation, regardless of whether such claims have merit.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur operating results have historically fluctuated due to seasonality and changes in our business, and our future operating results may vary significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the timing of our costs incurred in connection with the launch of new degree programs and the delay in receiving revenue from these new programs, which delay may last for several years;\n\u2022seasonal variation driven by the semester schedules for our university clients\u2019 degree programs and seasonal engagement patterns of students on the edX marketplace, which may vary from year to year;\n\u2022changes in the student enrollment and retention levels in our university clients\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022changes in our key metrics or the methods used to calculate our key metrics;\n\u2022changes in tuition rates;\n\u2022the timing and amount of our marketing and sales expenses;\n\u2022costs necessary to improve and maintain our platform;\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on the global economy, educational institutions and our results of operations;\n\u2022costs related to any acquisition and integration of business and technology;\n\u2022our ability to effectively integrate businesses and technologies that we acquire;\n\u2022impairment of goodwill or intangible assets; and\n\u2022changes in the prospects of the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective university clients\u2019 or students\u2019 spending priorities or could increase the time it takes us to launch new offerings.\nOur operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in some future periods, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u2022variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock or our failure to meet these financial estimates;\n\u2022conditions or trends in our industry, the stock market or the economy;\n\u2022the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\u2022stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the software and information technology industries;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022capital commitments;\n\u2022investors\u2019 general perception of our company and our business;\n\u2022actions instituted by activist shareholders or others;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders; and\n\u2022other factors such as political or social unrest, terrorist attacks, other hostilities, natural disasters and potential public health crises, such as COVID-19.\nActivist shareholders who disagree with the composition of our board of directors, our strategy or the way we are managed may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to publicity campaigns, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by our board of directors and litigation. Responding to these actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of our board of directors, management and employees and interfere with the execution of our strategic plan. A contested election could also require us to incur substantial legal and public relations fees and proxy solicitation expenses. The perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock.\nAs described in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against us and certain of our employees and directors. Our defense against this litigation has caused and will continue to cause us to incur additional expenses and continue to divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control is considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock\nwithout any further vote or action by our stockholders. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders, which could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u2022only one of our three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u2022stockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 662/3% vote and only for cause;\n\u2022stockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u2022stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022our board of directors is allowed to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022stockholders are required to give us advance notice of their intention to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware are the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, stockholders, or employees and, in turn, discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state or federal court in the State of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders; any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws; and any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to any action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and large stockholders may prevent smaller stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own a substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock. These persons, acting together, are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant corporate transaction. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains and you may never receive a return on your investment.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our Term Loan Agreement preclude, and the terms of any future debt agreements are likely to similarly preclude, us from paying dividends. As a result,\ncapital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, employees, and others regarding our environmental, social and governance practices and reporting could cause us to incur additional costs, devote additional resources and expose us to additional risks, which could adversely impact our reputation, customer acquisition and retention, access to capital and employee retention.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance, or ESG, practices and reporting. Investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders have focused increasingly on ESG practices and placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments, purchases and other interactions with companies. For example, many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company\u2019s ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with such company to improve ESG disclosure or performance and may also make voting decisions on this basis. With this increased focus and demand, public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected. If our ESG practices and reporting do not meet investor, customer, or employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand and reputation may be negatively impacted. Any disclosure we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of ESG matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG reporting, our ESG practices or our speed of adoption. We could also incur additional costs and devote additional resources to monitor, report and implement various ESG practices. If we fail, or are perceived to be failing, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure or the expectations of our various stakeholders, it could negatively impact our reputation, access to capital and employee retention.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This may require us to incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to further expand our accounting and finance functions and expend significant management efforts.\nWe may in the future discover material weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. In addition, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to errors or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or other regulatory authorities.",

Our mission is to expand access to high-quality educational opportunities that unlock human potential. In November 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of edX Inc. (the \u201cedX Acquisition\u201d), including the edX brand, website and marketplace. As a result of the edX Acquisition, we expanded our digital education offerings to include open courses and micro-credential offerings at the undergraduate and graduate levels and added an education consumer marketplace, edx.org, with over 42 million registered learners.\nFollowing the completion of the edX Acquisition, we now serve more than 230 top-ranked global universities and other leading institutions, and offer more than 3,600 high-quality online learning opportunities, including open courses, executive education offerings, boot camps, micro-credentials, professional certificates as well as undergraduate and graduate degree programs.\nWith the edX Acquisition, we are now positioned as one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive free-to-degree online learning platforms. We believe our platform and robust consumer marketplace provide our clients with the digital infrastructure to launch world-class online education offerings and allow students to easily access high-quality, job-relevant education offerings without the barriers of cost or location.\nWe have two reportable segments: the Degree Program Segment and the Alternative Credential Segment.\nIn our Degree Program Segment, we provide the technology and services to nonprofit colleges and universities to enable the online delivery of degree programs. Students enrolled in these programs are generally seeking an undergraduate or graduate degree of the same quality they would receive on campus.\nIn our Alternative Credential Segment, we provide premium online open courses, executive education programs, technical, skills-based boot camps and micro-credential programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels through relationships with nonprofit colleges and universities and other leading institutions. Students enrolled in these offerings are generally seeking to reskill or upskill for career advancement or personal development through shorter duration, lower-priced offerings.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread impacts on society and the global economy. Our focus remains on ensuring the health and safety of our employees and clients, while ensuring the continuity of our business. We have adapted our business practices to allow our global workforce to continue to work from home on a voluntary basis. In addition, many of our in-person offerings and other campus-based experiences are offered in a virtual format, including the field placement components in certain of our clinical graduate programs. Our course production capabilities allow faculty to record studio-quality asynchronous content remotely.\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The pandemic initially accelerated the need for online learning and training, but has also created new and different demand dynamics in the market. At the beginning of the pandemic, we experienced increased demand from new and existing university clients and students as universities moved classes online. We do not know if the university client and student demand levels we have experienced during the pandemic will continue. More recently, we have seen some of these pandemic-related trends subside in certain areas of our business. We have experienced fluctuations in our student retention rates and in our marketing costs. In particular, our marketing costs were lower earlier in the pandemic and began to increase in the second half of 2021. In addition, during the past year, competition for talent has increased, resulting in higher employee turnover and additional costs to attract and retain\nemployees.\nWe cannot estimate the impact of COVID-19 on future demand or cost levels or on our business or economic conditions generally, due to numerous uncertainties, including uncertainties regarding the duration or reemergence of the outbreak in various regions, including the potential impact of variants of the virus, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, future fluctuations in demand and cost levels and labor market conditions. For a discussion of additional risks related to COVID-19, see Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nCertain Trends and Uncertainties\nThe following represents a summary of certain trends and uncertainties, which could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. This summary is not intended to be a complete list of potential trends and uncertainties and should be considered along with the factors identified in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere in this report.\n\u2022The risk of a data security breach or service disruption has increased as the frequency, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. While we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our services and computer systems, our cybersecurity measures and the cybersecurity measures taken by our third-party software and service providers may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent all attempts to compromise our systems. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents may be heightened as a result of our employees and third-party service providers working remotely from networks that may be less secure.\n\u2022We and our university clients are subject to certain education laws and regulations that are frequently revised, repealed or expanded. Any administration may change certain DOE rules or policies in accordance with its policy priorities. The outcome of the process to re-authorize the HEA, any DOE rulemakings, or other law and policy changes may alter the regulatory landscape of the higher education industry, and thereby impact the manner in which we conduct business and serve our university clients.\n\u2022Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced increased demand for our technology and services from university clients, increased demand for our offerings from students, and a decrease in our marketing costs. Although we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend towards adoption of online education that was already in process prior to the pandemic, we have recently seen demand and marketing cost fluctuate. We do not know the impact that COVID-19 will have on future demand or cost levels.\n\u2022We believe the edX Acquisition will combine our industry-leading marketing capabilities with the edX marketplace will result in a scalable and sustainable marketing advantage and drive marketing cost efficiencies. We are in the early stages of the edX integration. If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of edX, or if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits resulting from the edX Acquisition, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Business Model and Components of Operating Results\nThe key elements of our business model and components of our operating results are described below.\nRevenue Drivers\nIn our Degree Program Segment, we derive substantially all of our revenue from revenue-share arrangements with our university clients under which we receive a contractually specified percentage of the amounts students pay them to enroll in degree programs. In our Alternative Credential Segment, we derive substantially all of our revenue from tuition and fees from students taking our executive education programs and boot camps. Revenue in each segment is primarily driven by the number of student enrollments in our offerings.\nOperating Expense\nMarketing and Sales\nOur most significant expense relates to marketing and sales activities to attract students to our offerings across both of our segments. This includes the cost of Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Marketing and Social Media Optimization, as well as personnel and personnel-related expense for our marketing and recruiting teams.\nIn our Degree Program Segment, our marketing and sales expense in any period generates student enrollments eight months later, on average. We then generate revenue as students progress through their programs, which generally occurs over a two-year period following initial enrollment. Accordingly, our marketing and sales expense in any period is an investment to\ngenerate revenue in future periods. Therefore, we do not believe it is meaningful to directly compare current period revenue to current period marketing and sales expense. Further, in this segment we believe that our marketing and sales expense in future periods will generally decline as a percentage of the revenue reported in those same periods as our revenue base from returning students in existing programs increases.\nIn our Alternative Credential Segment, our marketing and sales expense in any period generates student enrollments as much as 24 weeks later. We then generate revenue as students progress through their courses, which typically occurs over a two- to six-month period following initial enrollment.\nCurriculum and Teaching\nCurriculum and teaching expense consists primarily of amounts due to universities for licenses to use their brand names and other trademarks in connection with our executive education and boot camp offerings. The payments are based on contractually specified percentages of the tuition and fees we receive from students in those offerings. Curriculum and teaching expense also includes personnel and personnel-related expense for our executive education and boot camp instructional staff.\nServicing and Support\nServicing and support expense consists primarily of personnel and personnel-related expense associated with the management and operations of our educational offerings, as well as supporting students and faculty members. Servicing and support expense also includes expenses to support our platform, facilitate in-program field placements and student immersions, and assist with compliance requirements.\nTechnology and Content Development\nTechnology and content development expense consists primarily of personnel and personnel-related expense associated with the ongoing improvement and maintenance of our platform, as well as hosting and licensing expenses. Technology and content expense also includes the amortization of capitalized technology and content.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and personnel-related expense for our centralized functions, including executive management, legal, finance, human resources, and other departments that do not provide direct operational services. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees and other corporate expenses.\nNet Interest Income (Expense)\nNet interest income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense from our long-term debt and interest income from our cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense also includes the amortization of debt issuance costs.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nLoss on debt extinguishment consists of amounts recorded related to the retirement of our debt obligations.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency gains and losses, gains and losses related to the sale of investments and other non-operating income and expense.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax provisions for all periods consist of U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the period is based on a mix of higher-taxed and lower-taxed jurisdictions.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Operating Results\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table presents selected consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss data for each of the periods indicated.\n* Not meaningful for comparative purposes.\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $171.1 million, or 22.1%, to $945.7 million as compared to $774.5 million in 2020. Revenue from our Degree Program Segment increased $105.6 million, or 21.7%, primarily due to growth in full course equivalent (\u201cFCE\u201d) enrollments of 39,102, or 19.7% and a 1.7% increase in average revenue per FCE enrollment, from $2,456 to $2,497. Revenue from our Alternative Credential Segment increased $65.5 million, or 22.8%, primarily due to a 15.3% increase in average revenue per FCE enrollment, from $3,561 to $4,105, and growth in FCE enrollments of 5,251, or 6.5%.\nCurriculum and Teaching. Curriculum and teaching expense increased $22.8 million, or 21.2%, to $130.8 million as compared to $108.0 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $17.4 million for amounts owed to university clients resulting from revenue growth of our offerings in our Alternative Credential Segment. In addition, expense for instructional staff increased $4.0 million to support to higher FCE enrollments.\nServicing and Support. Servicing and support expense increased $12.7 million, or 10.1%, to $138.5 million as compared to $125.9 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to an $11.5 million increase in personnel and personnel-related expense and a $0.9 million increase in student support costs to serve a greater number of students.\nTechnology and Content Development. Technology and content development expense increased $23.1 million, or 14.8%, to $179.1 million as compared to $155.9 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a $7.4 million increase in expenses to support our platform and software applications, and a $4.9 million increase in personnel and personnel-related expense.\nMarketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expense increased $65.9 million, or 16.9%, to $456.1 million as compared to $390.2 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $59.6 million increase in marketing expense and a $4.8 million increase in personnel and personnel-related expense to support our revenue growth.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense increased $35.1 million, or 20.2%, to $208.6 million as compared to $173.5 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $14.6 million increase in transaction and integration expense, a $12.5 million increase in personnel and personnel-related expense, a $4.1 million increase in professional fees, a $3.5 million increase in provision for credit losses, a $2.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a $1.7 million increase in restructuring-related expense, and a $1.7 million increase in banking fees. Stockholder activism and litigation-related expense decreased by $5.0 million, primarily due to $5.6 million in legal fees associated with stockholder activism incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 which did not recur in 2021. This decrease was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in litigation-related expense.\nNet Interest Income (Expense). Net interest expense was $49.7 million and $26.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to interest incurred on our Notes and our $575 million aggregate principal amount of term loan facilities that were issued in June 2021 and amended in November 2021. The net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to interest incurred on our Notes that were issued in April 2020 and our $250 million senior secured term loan facility that was extinguished in April 2020.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment. Loss on debt extinguishment was $1.1 million and $11.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to the write-off of deferred financing costs and fees paid in connection with the termination of our $50 million credit agreement in June 2021. The loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the write-off of deferred financing costs and fees paid in connection with the extinguishment of our $250 million senior secured term loan facility in April 2020.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net was $22.3 million and $(1.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This increase was primarily due to the gain recognized in connection with the sale of our investment in an education technology company.\nIncome Tax Benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an income tax benefit of $1.2 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 0.6%. This income tax benefit was due to net operating losses and the reversal of taxable temporary differences of the acquired intangibles, as well as realization of deferred tax assets in our Alternative Credential Segment. There was also a tax expense recorded to establish a deferred tax liability related to the tax amortization of acquired edX indefinite lived intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of $1.5 million, and our effective tax rate was approximately 0.7%. This tax benefit was due to net operating losses and the reversal of taxable temporary differences of the acquired intangibles in our Alternative Credential Segment. We expect to continue to recognize an income tax benefit for our Alternative Credential Segment to the extent that this segment continues to generate pre-tax losses while carrying a net deferred tax liability. To date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal income taxes because of our current and accumulated net operating losses.\nBusiness Segment Operating Results\nWe define segment profitability as net income or net loss, as applicable, before net interest income (expense), other income (expense), net, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, deferred revenue fair value adjustments, transaction costs, integration costs, restructuring-related costs, stockholder activism costs, certain litigation-related costs, consisting of fees for certain non-ordinary course litigation and other proceedings, impairment charges, losses on debt extinguishment, and stock-based compensation expense. Some of these items may not be applicable in any given reporting period and they may vary from period to period. Total segment profitability is a non-GAAP measure when presented outside of the financial statement footnotes. Total segment profitability is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to develop short- and long-term operational plans and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating total segment profitability can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that total segment profitability provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of total segment profitability to net loss for each of the periods indicated.\n* Includes (i) transaction and integration expense of $16.9 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, (ii) restructuring-related expense of $8.5 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and (iii) stockholder activism and litigation-related expense of $2.4 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nYears Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table presents revenue by segment and segment profitability for each of the periods indicated.\n* Immaterial amounts of intersegment revenue have been excluded from the above results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nDegree Program Segment profitability increased $76.5 million, or 154%, to $126.1 million as compared to $49.6 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to revenue growth of $105.6 million and operational efficiency initiatives.\nAlternative Credential Segment profitability decreased $26.0 million, or 78%, to $(59.6) million as compared to $(33.5) million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in marketing and sales expense and the the contribution of $11.7 million in operating expense from edX.\nKey Business and Financial Performance Metrics\nWe use a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. In addition to adjusted EBITDA (loss), which we discuss\nbelow, and revenue and the components of loss from operations in the section above entitled \u201cOur Business Model and Components of Operating Results,\u201d we utilize FCE enrollments as a key metric to evaluate the success of our business.\nFull Course Equivalent Enrollments\nWe measure FCE enrollments for each of the courses offered during a particular period by taking the number of students enrolled in that course and multiplying it by the percentage of the course completed during that period. We add the FCE enrollments for each course within each segment to calculate the total FCE enrollments per segment. This metric allows us to consistently view period-over-period changes in enrollments by accounting for the fact that many courses we enable straddle multiple fiscal quarters. For example, if a course had 25 enrolled students and 40% of the course was completed during a particular period, we would count the course as having 10 FCE enrollments for that period. Any individual student may be enrolled in more than one course during a period.\nAverage revenue per FCE enrollment represents our weighted-average revenue per course across the mix of courses being offered during a period in each of our operating segments. This number is derived by dividing the total revenue for a period for each of our operating segments by the number of FCE enrollments within the applicable segment during that same period. This amount may vary from period to period depending on the academic calendars of our university clients, the relative growth rates of our degree programs, executive education programs, and boot camps, as applicable, and varying tuition levels, among other factors.\nThe following table presents the FCE enrollments and average revenue per FCE enrollment in our Degree Program Segment and Alternative Credential Segment for each of the periods indicated.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss)\nWe define adjusted EBITDA (loss) as net income or net loss, as applicable, before net interest income (expense), other income (expense), net, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, deferred revenue fair value adjustments, transaction costs, integration costs, restructuring-related costs, stockholder activism costs, certain litigation-related costs, consisting of fees for certain non-ordinary course litigation and other proceedings, impairment charges, losses on debt extinguishment, and stock-based compensation expense. Some of these items may not be applicable in any given reporting period and they may vary from period to period.\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA (loss) to exclude other income (expense), net in connection with the recognition of a gain on the sale of our interest in an education technology company. We believe this change is meaningful to investors because we did not have this activity in prior periods, and as a result, excluding the impact of such a gain in 2021 facilitates a period-to-period comparison of our business. Prior to this revision, our definition of adjusted EBITDA excluded foreign currency gains or losses, which comprised the entirety of our other income (expense), net for all prior periods. The revision to the definition of adjusted EBITDA (loss) had no impact on our reported adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss) is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to develop short- and long-term operational plans and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses that are not reflective of our ongoing operating results in calculating adjusted EBITDA (loss) can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA (loss) provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss) is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our use of\nadjusted EBITDA (loss) has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA (loss) does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA (loss) does not reflect (i) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (ii) the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; (iii) acquisition related gains or losses such as, but not limited to, post-acquisition changes in the value of contingent consideration reflected in operations; (iv) transaction and integration costs; (v) restructuring-related costs; (vi) impairment charges; (vii) stockholder activism costs; (viii) certain litigation-related costs; (ix) losses on debt extinguishment; (x) the impact of deferred revenue fair value adjustments; (xi) interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash; or (xii) the non-cash expense or the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation, which has been, and we expect will continue to be, an important part of our compensation plan; and\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA (loss) differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA (loss) alongside other U.S. GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other U.S. GAAP results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA (loss) to net loss for each of the periods indicated.\n* Includes (i) transaction and integration expense of $16.9 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, (ii) restructuring-related expense of $8.5 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and (iii) stockholder activism and litigation-related expense of $2.4 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $232.9 million, which were held for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nIn April 2020, we issued the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $380 million, including the exercise by the initial purchasers of an option to purchase additional Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The Notes are governed by an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2020. The Notes mature on May 1, 2025, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to November 1, 2024, the Notes are convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions, and thereafter at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading date immediately before the maturity date. In connection with the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with a premium cost of approximately $50.5 million. The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or to offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to the cap. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $319.0 million after deducting the initial purchasers\u2019 discount, offering expenses and the cost of the capped call transactions. As of December 31, 2021, the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had not been met and we have the right under the Indenture to determine the method of settlement at the time of conversion, and the Notes, therefore, are classified as a non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 9 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our Notes.\nOn April 23, 2020, we repaid our $250 million senior secured term loan facility in full (including interest and prepayment premium) and terminated our credit agreement with Owl Rock Capital Corporation. In connection with the extinguishment of our $250 million senior secured term loan facility, we recognized a charge of approximately $11.7 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nOn June 25, 2020, we entered into a $50 million credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain other lenders party thereto that provided for $50 million in revolving loans. In connection with entering into the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) in June 2021, we terminated our $50 million credit agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. Refer to Note 9 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nOn August 6, 2020, we sold 6,800,000 shares of our common stock to the public. We received net proceeds of $299.8 million, which we use for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nIn June 2021, we entered into a Term Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated June 28, 2021 (\u201cthe Term Loan Agreement\u201d), with Alter Domus (US) LLC as administrative agent and collateral agent, to make term loans to us in the aggregate principal amount of $475 million (the \u201cTerm Loan Facilities\u201d), which have an initial maturity date of December 28, 2024. Loans under this facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a base rate or adjusted Eurodollar rate, as applicable, plus the applicable margin of 4.75% in the case of the base rate loans and 5.75% in the case of the Eurodollar loans. We used the proceeds of the Term Loan Facilities to fund a portion of the edX Acquisition and to pay related costs, fees and expenses. On November 4, 2021, we entered into a First Amendment to Term Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement and a Joinder Agreement, which amended the Term Loan Agreement (collectively, the \u201cAmended Term Loan Facility\u201d) primarily to provide for an incremental facility to us in an original principal amount of $100 million. The proceeds of the Amended Term Loan Facility may be used for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 9 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our Amended Term Loan Facility.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through payments from university clients and students for our technology and services, the Amended Term Loan Facility, the Notes, and public and private equity financings. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under the Amended Term Loan Facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, debt obligations, and anticipated cash needs, and may consider capital raising and other market opportunities that may be available to us.\nOur operations require us to make capital expenditures for content development, capitalized technology, and property and equipment and to service our debt. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our capital asset additions were $72.0 million and $72.6 million, respectively.\nWe or our affiliates may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands).\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities have typically been generated from our net income (loss) and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense.\nNet cash used in operating activities increased $47.7 million from net cash provided by operating activities of $29.6 million in 2020 to net cash used in operating activities of $18.1 million in 2021. This increase was the result of a net increase in the use of cash of $80.9 million related to changes in net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decrease of $21.7 million in net loss, and a net increase of $11.6 million in non-cash adjustments.\nNet cash used from net changes in operating assets and liabilities increased $80.9 million from net cash provided of $18.4 million in 2020 to net cash used of $62.6 million. This net increase in cash used was primarily due to $42.4 million of net changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase of $19.7 million in accounts receivable and other receivables as a result of revenue growth, a lower increase in deferred revenue of $16.7 million on a comparative basis to prior year, and an increase of $2.2 million in cash used for prepaid expense and other assets.\nNon-cash adjustments increased $11.6 million from $227.7 million in 2020 to $239.3 million in 2021. This net increase was due to an increase of $49.9 million in non-cash adjustments, primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense. This increase was partially offset by a $27.8 million gain recognized during 2021, with no corresponding gain in 2020, in connection with the sale of our investment in an education technology company, and a net decrease of $10.6 million in loss on debt extinguishment driven by the 2020 settlement of our $250 million senior secured term loan facility.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities primarily consist of strategic acquisitions, divestitures and purchases of property and equipment to support the overall growth of our business. We expect our investing cash flows to be affected by the timing of payments we make for capital expenditures and the strategic acquisition or other growth opportunities we decide to pursue.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $724.1 million from $69.3 million in 2020 to $793.4 million in 2021. This net increase in cash used was primarily due to $761.1 million in use of cash for the 2021 business acquisition of edX and an increase of $3.3 million in cash outflows for property and equipment purchases. These cash uses were partially offset by $38.8 million in proceeds from the sale of investments, including $37.8 million from the sale of our investment in an education technology company completed in 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities primarily consist of long-term debt borrowings, the repayment of principal on long-term debt, tax withholding payments associated with the settlement of restricted stock units and the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $177.4 million from $367.5 million in 2020 to $544.9 million in 2021. This net increase in cash provided was primarily due to the increase of $192.2 million in net proceeds received from\nlong-term debt borrowings, net of payments related to the initial purchaser\u2019s discount, offering expenses, prepayment premium penalty, debt issuance costs, and the cost of the capped call transactions. Refer to Note 9 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our debt. In addition, the net increase in cash provided includes an increase of $2.3 million in cash proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Cash proceeds were partially offset by an increase of $14.0 million in tax withholding payments associated with the settlement of restricted stock units and an increase of $3.4 million in payments on our long-term debt.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our obligations under the Notes, deferred government grant obligations, non-cancelable operating leases, commitments to certain of our university clients in exchange for contract extensions and various marketing and other rights, and purchase obligations as of December 31, 2021. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts.\n* Amounts represent principal and interest.\n** Amounts represent principal and fixed-rate interest cash payments over the life of the convertible senior notes, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible senior notes would impact our cash payments.\n*** Other purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table above. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nContingent Payments\nWe have entered into agreements with certain of our university clients in our Degree Program Segment that require us to make future minimum payments in the event that certain program metrics are not achieved on an annual basis. We recognize any estimated contingent payments under these agreements as contra revenue over the period to which they relate, and record a liability in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we entered into an agreement to make investments in an education technology company of up to $15.0 million, upon demand by the investee. During the second quarter of 2021, we sold our investment in this education technology company and were released from any further obligation to make additional investments.\nSee Note 7 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 and \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThis management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions differ from our assumptions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition, Receivables and Provision for Credit Losses\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from contractual arrangements, with either our university clients or students, to provide a comprehensive platform of tightly integrated technology and technology-enabled services that support our offerings.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract\u2019s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the expected value method. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period, and if necessary, we adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method.\nOur Degree Program Segment derives revenue primarily from contractually specified percentages of the amounts our university clients receive from their students in 2U-enabled degree programs for tuition and fees, less credit card fees and other specified charges we have agreed to exclude in certain university contracts. Our contracts with university clients in this segment typically have terms of 10 to 15 years and have a single performance obligation, as the promises to provide a platform of tightly integrated technology and services that university clients need to attract, enroll, educate and support students are not distinct within the context of the contracts. The single performance obligation is delivered as the university clients receive and consume benefits, which occurs ratably over a series of academic terms. The amounts received from university clients over the term of the arrangement are variable in nature in that they are dependent upon the number of students that are enrolled in the program within each academic term. These amounts are allocated to and are recognized ratably over the related academic term, defined as the period beginning on the first day of classes through the last. Revenue is recognized net of an allowance, which is established for our expected obligation to refund tuition and fees to university clients.\nOur Alternative Credential Segment derives revenue primarily from contracts with students for the tuition and fees paid to enroll in, and progress through, our executive education programs and boot camps. Our executive education programs run between two and 16 weeks, while our boot camps run between 12 and 24 weeks. In this segment, our contracts with students include the delivery of the educational and related student support services and are treated as either a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations, depending upon the offering being delivered. All performance obligations are satisfied ratably over the same presentation period, which is defined as the period beginning on the first day of the course through the last. We recognize the proceeds received, net of any applicable pricing concessions, from the students enrolled and share contractually specified amounts received from students with the associated university client, in exchange for licenses to use the university brand name and other university trademarks. These amounts are recognized as curriculum and teaching expenses on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Our contracts with university clients in this segment are typically shorter and less restrictive than our contracts with university clients in our Degree Program Segment.\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for our Degree Program Segment because the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a service that forms part of a single performance obligation. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for our Alternative Credential Segment because the performance obligations are part of contracts that have original durations of less than one year.\nPayments to University Clients\nPursuant to certain of our contracts in the Degree Program Segment, we have made, or are obligated to make, payments to university clients at either the execution of a contract or at the extension of a contract in exchange for various marketing and other rights. Generally, these amounts are capitalized as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, and amortized as contra revenue over the life of the contract, commencing on the later of when payment is due or when contract revenue recognition begins.\nReceivables, Contract Assets and Liabilities\nBalance sheet items related to contracts consist of accounts receivable, net, other receivables, net and deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. Accounts receivable, net includes trade accounts receivable, which are comprised of billed and unbilled revenue. Our trade accounts receivable balances have terms of less than one year. Accounts receivable, net is stated at amortized cost net of provision for credit losses. Our methodology to measure the provision for credit losses requires an estimation of loss rates based upon historical loss experience adjusted for factors that are relevant to determining the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Some of these factors include current market conditions, delinquency trends, aging behavior of receivables and credit and liquidity quality indicators for industry groups, customer classes or individual customers. Our estimates are reviewed and revised periodically based on the ongoing evaluation of credit quality indicators. Historically, actual write-offs for uncollectible accounts have not significantly differed from prior estimates.\nWe recognize unbilled revenue when revenue recognition occurs in advance of billings. Unbilled revenue is recognized in our Degree Program Segment because billings to university clients do not occur until after the academic term has commenced and final enrollment information is available. Our unbilled revenue represents contract assets.\nOther receivables, net are comprised of amounts due under tuition payment plans with extended payment terms from students enrolled in certain of our alternative credential offerings. These plans, which are managed and serviced by third-party providers, are designed to assist students with covering tuition costs after all other student financial assistance and scholarships have been applied. The associated receivables generally have payment terms that exceed one year and are recorded net of any implied pricing concessions, which are determined based on our collections history, market data and any time value of money component. There are no fees or origination costs included in these receivables.\nDeferred revenue represents the excess of amounts billed or received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the end of the reporting period, and such amounts are reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Our deferred revenue represents contract liabilities. We generally receive payments from Degree Program Segment university clients early in each academic term and from Alternative Credential Segment students, either in full upon registration for the course or in full before the end of the course based on a payment plan, prior to completion of the service period. These payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are delivered or until our obligations are otherwise met, at which time revenue is recognized.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill. The net assets and results of operations of an acquired entity are included on our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nThe purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nOn November 16, 2021, we completed the edX Acquisition for a preliminary purchase price of $773 million. Refer to Note 3 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding this transaction.\nLong-Lived Assets\nAmortizable Intangible Assets\nAcquired Definite-lived Intangible Assets. We capitalize purchased definite-lived intangible assets, such as software, websites and domains, and amortize them on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Historically, we have assessed the useful lives of these acquired intangible assets to be between three and 10 years.\nCapitalized Technology. Capitalized technology includes certain purchased software and technology licenses, direct third-party costs, and internal payroll and payroll-related costs used in the creation of our internal-use software. Software development projects generally include three stages: the preliminary project stage (all costs are expensed as incurred), the application development stage (certain costs are capitalized and certain costs are expensed as incurred) and the post-\nimplementation/operation stage (all costs are expensed as incurred). Costs capitalized in the application development stage include costs of designing the application, coding, integrating our and the university\u2019s networks and systems, and the testing of the software. Capitalization of costs requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the application development stage and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software. Once the software is placed in service, these amounts are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three to five years.\nCapitalized Content Development. We develop content for each offering on a course-by-course basis in collaboration with university client faculty and industry experts. Depending upon the offering, we may use materials provided by university clients and their faculty, including curricula, case studies, presentations and other reading materials. We are responsible for the creation of materials suitable for delivery through our online learning platform, including all expenses associated with this effort. With respect to the Degree Program Segment, the development of content is part of our single performance obligation and is considered a contract fulfillment cost.\nThe content development costs that qualify for capitalization are third-party direct costs, such as videography, editing and other services associated with creating digital content. Additionally, we capitalize internal payroll and payroll-related expenses incurred to create and produce videos and other digital content utilized in the university clients\u2019 offerings for delivery via our online learning platform. Capitalization ends when content has been fully developed by both us and the university client, at which time amortization of the capitalized content development begins. The capitalized costs for each offering are recorded on a course-by-course basis and included in amortizable intangible assets, net on our consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the respective course, which is generally four to five years. The estimated useful life corresponds with the planned curriculum refresh rate. This refresh rate is consistent with expected curriculum refresh rates as cited by faculty members for similar on-campus offerings.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment, capitalized technology, capitalized content development and acquired finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to assess the recoverability of the capitalized technology and content development, the amounts are grouped by the lowest level of independent cash flows. Recoverability of a long-lived asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group. If such assets are not recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds the estimated fair value (discounted cash flow) of the asset or asset group. Our impairment analysis is based upon cumulative results and forecasted performance.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe review goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, as of October 1, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill or an indefinite-lived asset below its carrying value.\nGoodwill\nWe test our goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. We initially assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment review. We review goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach if we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment or determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based on a qualitative assessment. Upon completion of a quantitative assessment, we may be required to recognize an impairment based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting unit.\nWe determine the fair value of a reporting unit by utilizing a weighted combination of the income-based and market-based approaches.\nThe income-based approach requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include, but are not limited to, the selection of appropriate peer group companies, discount rates, terminal growth rates, and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization expense, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, we consider each reporting unit\u2019s historical results and current operating trends, revenue, profitability, cash flow results and forecasts, and industry trends. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, market capitalization, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and prospective student enrollment patterns.\nIn addition, the value of a reporting unit using the market-based approach is estimated by comparing the reporting unit to other publicly-traded companies and/or to publicly-disclosed business mergers and acquisitions in similar lines of business. The value of a reporting unit is based on pricing multiples of certain financial parameters observed in the comparable companies. We also make estimates and assumptions for market values to determine a reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value.\nChanges in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the goodwill impairment test result. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the goodwill balance was $834.5 million and $415.8 million, respectively. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information regarding goodwill.\nBased on our quantitative assessment performed during 2019 and the qualitative assessments performed as of October 1 in 2020 and 2021, we believe that the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values by no less than 10%. It is possible that future changes in our circumstances, including potential impacts from COVID-19, or in the variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates used in assessing the fair value of our reporting units, could require us to record impairment charges in the future. Subsequent to year-end and through the date of this filing, we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization, from $1.5 billion to $0.8 billion. Management is evaluating whether this decline represents a triggering event for assessing the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances for impairment in the first quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the balances of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset were $834.5 million and $255.0 million, respectively.\nOther Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nOur indefinite-lived intangible asset was acquired in November 2021 and represents the established edX trade name. Given the timing of the edX Acquisition, we will review this asset for impairment as of October 1, 2022, or earlier if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of this asset below its carrying value.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe provide stock-based compensation awards consisting of restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), performance restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d) and stock options to employees, directors and consultants. We measure all stock-based compensation awards at fair value as of the grant date. The fair values of RSUs and PRSUs containing performance-based vesting conditions are based on the fair value of our stock on the date of grant. We use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants and a Monte Carlo valuation model to estimate the fair value of PRSUs containing market-based vesting conditions . We also maintain the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) and estimate the fair value of each purchase right thereunder as of the grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. For stock option grants, the risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our employee stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the \u201csimplified method.\u201d Under the \u201csimplified method,\u201d the expected life of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the \u201csimplified method\u201d due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the estimated expected life of the stock options. We assume no dividend yield because dividends are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not declaring or paying dividends to date.\nFor PRSUs subject to market-based vesting conditions, the risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected life of the awards. The expected life is consistent with the performance measurement period of the awards. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the estimated expected life. We assume no dividend yield because dividends are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not declaring or paying dividends to date. The valuations determined by the Monte Carlo simulation utilize 50,000 future stock prices for us and our peer group. We have chosen this amount for the simulation as to minimize the standard modeling error and believe that the resulting distribution gives a reasonable estimate of the grant date fair value.\nFor awards subject only to service-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards\u2019 requisite service period. For awards subject to both service and performance-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. For awards subject to both service and market-based vesting conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period beginning with the date of the grant and ending upon completion of the service period, with stock-based compensation expense being recognized irrespective of the achievement of the market condition. For shares subject to the ESPP, we use the straight-line method to record stock-based compensation expense over the respective offering period.\nRefer to Note 12 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our stock-based compensation awards.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the FASB\u2019s recent accounting pronouncements and their effect on us.",
    "item_7A": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. Our exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is deemed moderate as further described below. In addition, we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative, hedging or trading purposes, although in the future we may enter into exchange rate hedging arrangements to manage the risks described in the succeeding paragraphs.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk through our borrowings under our Amended Term Loan Facility. Loans under this facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a base rate or adjusted Eurodollar rate, as applicable, plus the applicable margin of 4.75% in the case of the base rate loans and 5.75% in the case of the Eurodollar loans. As of December 31, 2021, borrowings under our Amended Term Loan Facility were $572.4 million. A hypothetical change in interest rates by 100 basis points would not have a material impact on our financial position.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact material business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposures are related to non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and operating expenses in South Africa and the United Kingdom. Accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end. As a result, we would experience increased revenue and operating expenses in our non-U.S. operations if there were a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies. Conversely, we would experience decreased revenue and operating expenses in our non-U.S. operations if there were an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our foreign currency translation adjustment was a loss of $6.1 million and a loss of $3.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized foreign currency exchange losses of $2.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, included on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nThe foreign exchange rate volatility of the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2021 was 11% and 5% for the South African rand and British pound, respectively. The foreign exchange rate volatility of the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2020 was 13% and 9% for the South African rand and British pound, respectively. A 10% fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on our results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Such volatility, even when it increases our revenue or decreases our expense, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n2U, Inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPAGE\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (KPMG, LLP, McLean, VA Auditor Firm ID: 185)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 65\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 66\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 67\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 68\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\n2U, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 2U, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nDetermination of implied pricing concessions\nAs discussed in Note14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\u2019s Alternative Credential Segment recorded revenue of $353 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the transaction price in certain contracts with customers of the Alternative Credential Segment includes variable consideration, subject to a constraint, in the form of implied pricing concessions. The Company initially estimates the value of implied pricing concessions, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, at contract inception and updates the estimate in each reporting period based on the Company\u2019s own collection history data and market data.\nWe identified the assessment of the estimated implied pricing concessions as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment was involved in evaluating the reliability of market data and the weighting applied to the Company\u2019s own collection history data and the market data used in estimating the overall rate of implied pricing concessions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company\u2019s process to estimate the overall rate of\nimplied pricing concessions, including controls related to the reliability of the market data and determination of the weighting applied to the Company\u2019s own collection history data and market data used in the estimate. We evaluated the reliability of the market data by considering the source and nature of the data. We evaluated the reasonableness of the weighting applied to the Company\u2019s own collection history data and market data by performing sensitivity analyses over those inputs and by comparing the Company\u2019s overall rate of implied pricing concessions to data published by certain agencies of the federal government.\nEvaluation of acquisition-date fair value of acquired intangible assets\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 16, 2021, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of edX, Inc. (edX) in a business combination. As a result of the transaction, the Company acquired trade names and university client relationships as intangible assets with acquisition-date fair value of $255 million and $104 million, respectively.\nWe identified the evaluation of the initial measurement of the trade names and university client relationships intangible assets acquired in the edX transaction as a critical audit matter. The estimated acquisition-date fair values of these intangible assets were sensitive to changes in significant assumptions used to measure their fair values. Specifically, there was a high degree of subjective auditor judgment involved in evaluating:\n\u2022the forecasted revenue growth, forecasted margins on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA margins), and the discount rate used to value the trade names\n\u2022the forecasted revenue used to value the university client relationships.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s acquisition-date valuation process to develop the significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the forecasted revenue growth and EBITDA margins used to value the trade names by comparing them to those of the Company\u2019s peers and edX\u2019s historical results. We evaluated the forecasted revenue used to value the university client relationships by comparing it to edX\u2019s historical results. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\u2022evaluating the Company\u2019s discount rate used to value the trade names by comparing it against a discount rate that was independently developed using publicly available third-party market data for comparable entities\n\u2022developing an estimate of the fair value of the trade names using the Company\u2019s forecasted cash flows and our independently developed discount rate and comparing the result to the Company\u2019s fair value estimate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2013.\nMcLean, Virginia\nMarch 1, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\n2U, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited 2U, Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule II-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 1, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company completed the edX Acquisition during 2021, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, edX\u2019s internal control over financial reporting associated with 1% of total assets and 1% of total revenue included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of edX, Inc.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nMcLean, Virginia\nMarch 1, 2022\n2U, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n2U, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n2U, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity\n(in thousands, except share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n2U, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Organization\n2U, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the \u201cCompany\u201d) is an online education platform company. The Company\u2019s mission is to expand access to high-quality educational opportunities that unlock human potential.\nOn November 16, 2021, pursuant to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated June 28, 2021 (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d), by and among the Company, edX Inc., a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation (\u201cedX Inc.\u201d) and edX LLC (f/k/a Circuit Sub LLC), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of edX Inc. (\u201cedX\u201d), edX Inc. contributed substantially all of its assets to edX and the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding membership interests of edX (the \u201cedX Acquisition\u201d) including the edX brand, website, and marketplace.\nAs a result of the edX Acquisition, the Company expanded its digital education offerings to include open courses and micro-credential offerings at the undergraduate and graduate levels and added an education consumer marketplace, edx.org, with over 42 million registered learners. Substantially all of the results of edX\u2019s operations are included in the Alternative Credential Segment.\nFollowing the completion of the edX Acquisition, the Company now serves more than 230 top-ranked global universities and other leading institutions, and offers more than 3,600 high-quality online learning opportunities, including open courses, executive education offerings, boot camps, micro-credentials, professional certificates as well as undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The Company expects edX to be the primary brand for its products and services and that edx.org will operate as its global online learning marketplace. Refer to Note 3 for further information about the edX Acquisition.\nWith the edX Acquisition, the Company is now positioned as one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive free-to-degree online learning platforms. The Company believes its platform and robust consumer marketplace provide clients with the digital infrastructure to launch world-class online education offerings and allow students to easily access high-quality, job-relevant education offerings without the barriers of cost or location.\nThe Company has two reportable segments: the Degree Program Segment and the Alternative Credential Segment.\nThe Company\u2019s Degree Program Segment provides the technology and services to nonprofit colleges and universities to enable the online delivery of degree programs. Students enrolled in these programs are generally seeking an undergraduate or graduate degree of the same quality they would receive on campus. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company changed the name of this segment from Graduate Program Segment to Degree Program Segment because this segment now includes undergraduate degree programs.\nThe Company\u2019s Alternative Credential Segment provides online executive education programs and technical, skills-based boot camps through relationships with nonprofit colleges and universities. Students enrolled in these offerings are generally seeking to reskill or upskill through shorter duration, lower-priced offerings that are relevant to the needs of industry and society. Following the edX Acquisition, we changed the name of our \u201cshort courses\u201d in our Alternative Credential Segment to \u201cexecutive education\u201d to more clearly align with industry terminology.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and include the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nThe Company has reclassified prior period amounts in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation of other receivables. Within the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, the Company reclassified $1.1 million from prepaid expenses and other assets to other receivables, net and $24.3 million from other assets, non-current to other receivables, net, non-current. Within the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company reclassified $21.1\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nmillion and $1.4 million, respectively, from changes in prepaid expenses and other assets to changes in other receivables. This reclassification had no impact on the previously reported operating cash flows.\nThe Company has reclassified certain other prior period amounts in the consolidation statements of cash flows to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported operating, financing, or financing cash flows.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported herein. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant items subject to such estimates include, but are not limited to, the measurement of provisions for credit losses, implied price concessions, acquired intangible assets, the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, deferred tax assets, and the fair value of the convertible senior notes. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.\nRevenue Recognition, Receivables and Provision for Credit Losses\nThe Company generates substantially all of its revenue from contractual arrangements, with either its university clients or students, to provide a comprehensive platform of tightly integrated technology and technology-enabled services that support its offerings.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract\u2019s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the expected value method. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company\u2019s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period, and if necessary, the Company adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance using the cumulative catch-up method.\nThe Degree Program Segment derives revenue primarily from contractually specified percentages of the amounts the Company\u2019s university clients receive from their students in 2U-enabled degree programs for tuition and fees, less credit card fees and other specified charges the Company has agreed to exclude in certain university contracts. The Company\u2019s contracts with university clients in this segment typically have terms of 10 to 15 years and have a single performance obligation, as the promises to provide a platform of tightly integrated technology and services that university clients need to attract, enroll, educate and support students are not distinct within the context of the contracts. The single performance obligation is delivered as the university clients receive and consume benefits, which occurs ratably over a series of academic terms. The amounts received from university clients over the term of the arrangement are variable in nature in that they are dependent upon the number of students that are enrolled in the program within each academic term. These amounts are allocated to and are recognized ratably over the related academic term, defined as the period beginning on the first day of classes through the last. Revenue is recognized net of an allowance, which is established for the Company\u2019s expected obligation to refund tuition and fees to university clients.\nThe Alternative Credential Segment derives revenue primarily from contracts with students for the tuition and fees paid to enroll in, and progress through, the Company\u2019s executive education programs and boot camps. The Company\u2019s executive education programs run between two and 16 weeks, while boot camps run between 12 and 24 weeks. In this segment, the Company\u2019s contracts with students include the delivery of the educational and related student support services and are treated as either a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations, depending upon the offering being delivered. All performance obligations are satisfied ratably over the same presentation period, which is defined as the period beginning on the first day of the course through the last. The Company recognizes the proceeds received, net of any applicable pricing concessions, from the students enrolled and shares contractually specified amounts received from students with the\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nassociated university client, in exchange for licenses to use the university brand name and other university trademarks. These amounts are recognized as curriculum and teaching expenses on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company\u2019s contracts with university clients in this segment are typically shorter and less restrictive than the Company\u2019s contracts with university clients in the Degree Program Segment.\nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for the Degree Program Segment because the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for the Alternative Credential Segment because the performance obligations are part of contracts that have original durations of less than one year.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nThe Company pays commissions to certain of its employees to obtain contracts with university clients in the Degree Program Segment. These costs are capitalized and recorded on a contract-by-contract basis and amortized using the straight-line method over the expected life, which is generally the length of the contract.\nWith respect to contract acquisition costs in the Alternative Credential Segment, the Company has elected to apply the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 606 to expense these costs as incurred, as the terms of contracts with students in this segment are less than one year.\nPayments to University Clients\nPursuant to certain of the Company\u2019s contracts in the Degree Program Segment, the Company has made, or is obligated to make, payments to university clients at either the execution of a contract or at the extension of a contract in exchange for various marketing and other rights. Generally, these amounts are capitalized as other assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, and amortized as contra revenue over the life of the contract, commencing on the later of when payment is due or when contract revenue recognition begins.\nReceivables, Contract Assets and Liabilities\nBalance sheet items related to contracts consist of accounts receivable, net, other receivables, net, and deferred revenue on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Accounts receivable, net includes trade accounts receivable, which are comprised of billed and unbilled revenue. The Company\u2019s trade accounts receivable balances have terms of less than one year. Accounts receivable, net is stated at amortized cost net of provision for credit losses. The Company\u2019s methodology to measure the provision for credit losses requires an estimation of loss rates based upon historical loss experience adjusted for factors that are relevant to determining the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Some of these factors include current market conditions, delinquency trends, aging behavior of receivables and credit and liquidity quality indicators for industry groups, customer classes or individual customers. The Company\u2019s estimates are reviewed and revised periodically based on the ongoing evaluation of credit quality indicators. Historically, actual write-offs for uncollectible accounts have not significantly differed from prior estimates.\nThe Company recognizes unbilled revenue when revenue recognition occurs in advance of billings. Unbilled revenue is recognized in the Degree Program Segment because billings to university clients do not occur until after the academic term has commenced and final enrollment information is available. The Company\u2019s unbilled revenue represents contract assets.\nOther receivables, net are comprised of amounts due under tuition payment plans with extended payment terms from students enrolled in certain of the Company\u2019s alternative credential offerings. These plans, which are managed and serviced by third-party providers, are designed to assist students with covering tuition costs after all other student financial assistance and scholarships have been applied. The associated receivables generally have payment terms that range from 12 to 42 months and are recorded net of any implied pricing concessions, which are determined based on our collections history, market data and any time value of money component. There are no fees or origination costs included in these receivables.\nDeferred revenue represents the excess of amounts billed or received as compared to amounts recognized in revenue on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as of the end of the reporting period, and such amounts are reflected as a current liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The Company\u2019s deferred revenue represents contract liabilities. The Company generally receives payments from Degree Program Segment university clients early in each academic term and from Alternative Credential Segment students, either in full upon registration for the course or in full before the end of the course based on a payment plan, prior to completion of the service period. These payments are\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nrecorded as deferred revenue until the services are delivered or until the Company\u2019s obligations are otherwise met, at which time revenue is recognized.\nMarketing and Sales Costs\nThe Company\u2019s marketing and sales costs relate to activities to attract students to offerings across both of the Company\u2019s segments. This includes the cost of Search Engine Optimization, Search Engine Marketing and Social Media Optimization, as well as personnel and personnel-related expense for the Company\u2019s marketing and recruiting teams. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, expense related to the Company\u2019s marketing and advertising efforts of its own brand were not material. All such costs are expensed as incurred and reported in marketing and sales expense on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company provides stock-based compensation awards consisting of restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), performance restricted stock units (\u201cPRSUs\u201d) and stock options to employees, directors and consultants. The Company measures all stock-based compensation awards at fair value as of the grant date. The fair values of RSUs and PRSUs containing performance-based vesting conditions are based on the fair value of the Company\u2019s stock on the date of grant. The Company uses a Monte Carlo valuation model to estimate the fair value of PRSUs containing market-based vesting conditions and uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock option grants. The Company also maintains the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) and estimates the fair value of each purchase right thereunder as of the grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nFor awards subject only to service-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the awards\u2019 requisite service period. For awards subject to both service and performance-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. For awards subject to both service and market-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense using an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period beginning with the date of the grant and ending upon completion of the service period, with stock-based compensation expense being recognized irrespective of the achievement of the market condition. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. For shares subject to the ESPP, the Company uses the straight-line method to record stock-based compensation expense over the respective offering period.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about the Company\u2019s stock-based compensation awards.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are included in the financial statements. Under this method, the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on the deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. Deferred tax assets are subject to periodic recoverability assessments. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized. The Company considers all positive and negative evidence relating to the realization of the deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. The Company currently maintains a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain entities in the foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Step one, recognition, occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Step two, measurement, determines the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur if the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank checking accounts, money market accounts, investments in certificates of deposit that have an original maturity of three months or less and highly liquid marketable securities with maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company maintains restricted cash as collateral for standby letters of credit for the Company\u2019s leased facilities and in connection with the deferred government grant obligations.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, advances to university clients, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the Company\u2019s principal or, in the absence of a principal, most advantageous, market for the specific asset or liability.\nU.S. GAAP provides for a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company remeasures non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment, and records them at fair value only when recognizing an impairment loss. The fair value hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Refer to Notes 4 and 5 for further discussion of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The three tiers are defined as follows:\n\u2022Level 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n\u2022Level 2-Observable inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities; and\n\u2022Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe Company has financial instruments, including cash deposits, receivables, accounts payable and debt. The carrying values for such financial instruments, other than than the Company\u2019s convertible senior notes, each approximated their fair values as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Refer to Note 9 for more information regarding the Company\u2019s convertible senior notes.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Expenditures for major additions, construction and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization is expensed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to five years for computer hardware and five to seven years for furniture and office equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the estimated useful life of the improvement, which generally ranges from four to approximately 11 years. Useful lives of significant assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted prospectively to reflect the Company\u2019s current estimates of the respective assets\u2019 expected utility. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nAmortizable Intangible Assets\nAcquired Definite-lived Intangible Assets. The Company capitalizes purchased intangible assets, such as software, websites and domains, and amortizes them on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Historically, the Company has assessed the useful lives of these acquired intangible assets to be between three and 10 years.\nCapitalized Technology. Capitalized technology includes certain purchased software and technology licenses, direct third-party costs, and internal payroll and payroll-related costs used in the creation of our internal-use software. Software development projects generally include three stages: the preliminary project stage (all costs are expensed as incurred), the application development stage (certain costs are capitalized and certain costs are expensed as incurred) and the post-implementation/operation stage (all costs are expensed as incurred). Costs capitalized in the application development stage include costs of designing the application, coding, integrating the Company\u2019s and the university\u2019s networks and systems, and the testing of the software. Capitalization of costs requires judgment in determining when a project has reached the application development stage and the period over which the Company expects to benefit from the use of that software. Once the software is placed in service, these amounts are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally three to five years.\nCapitalized Content Development. The Company develops content for each offering on a course-by-course basis in collaboration with university client faculty and industry experts. Depending upon the offering, the Company may use materials provided by university clients and their faculty, including curricula, case studies, presentations and other reading materials. The Company is responsible for the creation of materials suitable for delivery through the Company\u2019s online learning platform, including all expenses associated with this effort. With respect to the Degree Program Segment, the development of content is part of the Company\u2019s single performance obligation and is considered a contract fulfillment cost.\nThe content development costs that qualify for capitalization are third-party direct costs, such as videography, editing and other services associated with creating digital content. Additionally, the Company capitalizes internal payroll and payroll-related expenses incurred to create and produce videos and other digital content utilized in the university clients\u2019 offerings for delivery via the Company\u2019s online learning platform. Capitalization ends when content has been fully developed by both the Company and the university client, at which time amortization of the capitalized content development begins. The capitalized costs for each offering are recorded on a course-by-course basis and included in intangible assets, net on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the respective course, which is generally four to five years. The estimated useful life corresponds with the planned curriculum refresh rate. This refresh rate is consistent with expected curriculum refresh rates as cited by faculty members for similar on-campus offerings.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment, capitalized technology, capitalized content development and acquired finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to assess the recoverability of the capitalized technology and content development, the amounts are grouped by the lowest level of independent cash flows. Recoverability of a long-lived asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group. If such assets are not recoverable, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds the estimated fair value (discounted cash flow) of the asset or asset group. The Company\u2019s impairment analysis is based upon cumulative results and forecasted performance.\nNon-Cash Long-Lived Asset Additions\nThe Company had non-cash capital asset additions of $1.8 million and $3.3 million in property and equipment, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company reviews goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, as of October 1, and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill or an indefinite-lived asset below its carrying value.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identified net assets of businesses acquired. The Company\u2019s goodwill balance relates to its acquisitions of GetSmarter in July 2017, Trilogy in May 2019 and edX in November 2021. The Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company initially assesses qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment review. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach if it decides to bypass the qualitative assessment or determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based on a qualitative assessment. Upon completion of a quantitative assessment, the Company may be required to recognize an impairment based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting unit.\nThe Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit by utilizing a weighted combination of the income-based and market-based approaches.\nThe income-based approach requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include, but are not limited to, the selection of appropriate peer group companies, discount rates, terminal growth rates, and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization expense, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the Company considers each reporting unit\u2019s historical results and current operating trends, revenue, profitability, cash flow results and forecasts, and industry trends. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic and regulatory conditions, market capitalization, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and prospective student enrollment patterns.\nIn addition, the value of a reporting unit using the market-based approach is estimated by comparing the reporting unit to other publicly traded companies and/or to publicly-disclosed business mergers and acquisitions in similar lines of business. The value of a reporting unit is based on pricing multiples of certain financial parameters observed in the comparable companies. The Company also makes estimates and assumptions for market values to determine a reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value.\nBased on the Company\u2019s quantitative assessment performed during 2019 and the qualitative assessments performed as of October 1 in 2020 and 2021, the Company believes that the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values by no less than 10%. It is possible that future changes in the Company\u2019s circumstances, including potential impacts from COVID-19, or in the variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates used in assessing the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units, could require the Company to record additional impairment charges in the future.\nOther Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company\u2019s indefinite-lived intangible asset was acquired in November 2021 and represents the established edX trade name. Given the timing of the edX Acquisition, the Company will review this asset for impairment as of October 1, 2022, or earlier if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of this asset below its carrying value.\nEquity Interests\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had a $10.0 million investment in an education technology company recorded within other assets, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. This investment did not have a readily determinable fair value, and was accounted for as a cost method investment, which was subject to fair value remeasurement upon the occurrence of an observable event. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company sold its investment in this education technology company and recorded a gain on sale of $27.8 million. Refer to Note 7 for further information.\nEmployee Benefits\nThe Company offers a variety of benefits to its employees (e.g., health care, gym memberships and tuition reimbursement). The Company accounts for costs related to providing employee benefits as incurred, unless there is a service requirement, in which case, such costs are recognized over the service commitment period.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn April 2020, the Company issued 2.25% convertible senior notes due May 1, 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $380 million, including the exercise by the initial purchasers of an option to purchase additional Notes, in a private offering. Refer to Note 9 for more information regarding the Notes.\nThe Notes are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d). Pursuant to ASC 470-20, issuers of certain convertible debt instruments, such as the Notes, that have a net settlement feature and may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion are required to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument. The carrying amount of the liability component of the instrument is computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion option using a market-based approach. The amount of the equity component is then calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the instrument. The difference between the principal amount and the liability component represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, the allocation of issuance costs incurred between the liability and equity components was based on their relative values.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs are incurred as a result of entering into certain borrowing transactions and are presented as a reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the associated debt instrument. The amortization of debt issuance costs is included as a component of interest expense on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. If the Company extinguishes debt prior to the end of the underlying instrument\u2019s full term, some or all of the unamortized debt issuance costs may need to be written off, and a loss on extinguishment may need to be recognized. Refer to Note 9 for further information about the Company\u2019s debt.\nLeases\nFor the Company\u2019s operating leases, an assessment is performed to determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the information necessary to determine the rate implicit in the Company\u2019s leases is not readily available, the Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any prepaid lease payments made, less lease incentives. The Company\u2019s lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company does not have any finance leases for any periods presented.\nThe Company has elected, as an accounting policy for its leases of real estate, to account for lease and non-lease components in a contract as a single lease component. In addition, the recognition requirements are not applied to leases with a term of 12 months or less. Rather, the lease payments for short-term leases are recognized on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nVariable payments that depend on an index or a rate are initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date. Such variable payments are included in the total lease payments when measuring the lease liabilities and ROU assets. The Company will only remeasure variable payments that depend on an index or a rate when the Company is remeasuring the lease liabilities due to any of the following occurring: (i) the lease is modified and the modification is not accounted for as a separate contract; (ii) a contingency, upon which some or all of the variable lease payments that will be paid over the remainder of the lease term are based, is resolved; (iii) there is a change in lease term; (iv) there is a change in the probability of exercising a purchase option; or (v) there is a change in the amount probable of being owed under residual value guarantees. Until the lease liabilities are remeasured due to one of the aforementioned events, additional payments for an increase in the index or rate will be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. Variable payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are excluded from the measurement of the lease liabilities and recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nBusiness Combinations\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired, including intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill. The net assets and results of operations of an acquired entity are included on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nForeign Currency Translation\nFor the portion of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. business where the local currency is the functional currency, operating results are translated into U.S. dollars using the average rate of exchange for the period, and assets and liabilities are converted at the closing rates on the period end date. Gains and losses on translation of these accounts are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholder\u2019s equity and comprehensive loss.\nFor any transaction that is in a currency different from the entity\u2019s functional currency, the Company records a gain or loss based on the difference between the exchange rate at the transaction date and the exchange rate at the transaction settlement date (or rate at period end, if unsettled) as other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. All of the Company\u2019s cash is held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. The Company\u2019s bank accounts exceed federally insured limits at times. The Company has not experienced any losses on cash to date. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, if needed, based on collection history.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-10, Codification Improvements. The amendments in this ASU affect a wide variety of topics in the Accounting Standards Codification by either clarifying the codification or correcting unintended application of guidance. The amendments do not change U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are not expected to result in a significant change in current accounting practice. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The new guidance requires companies to apply ASC Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities with customers acquired in a business combination, which creates an exception to the general recognition principle in ASC Topic 805. In addition, the guidance clarifies that companies should apply the definition of a performance obligation in ASC Topic 606 when recognizing contract liabilities assumed in a business combination. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the standard in the fourth quarter of 2021, effective January 1, 2021. Adoption of this standard is reflected in the preliminary purchase price allocation of the edX Acquisition. Refer to Note 3 for further information about the edX Acquisition.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. This ASU simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts indexed to and potentially settled in an entity\u2019s own equity. The new guidance eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments. As a result, in more cases, convertible debt will be accounted for as a single instrument. The guidance also removes certain conditions for equity classification related to contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity and requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted.\nThe Company will adopt this ASU on a modified retrospective basis in the first quarter of 2022, effective as of January 1, 2022. The Company expects that the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nfinancial statements. Although the Company continues to evaluate the effect of the ASU on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the adoption of this ASU is expected to result in an increase in long-term debt of approximately $81.7 million to reflect the full principal amount of the Notes outstanding, net of issuance costs, a reduction of approximately $114.6 million to additional paid-in capital to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the Notes, a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of approximately $22.1 million, and a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening accumulated deficit of $32.8 million. After the adoption of this ASU, the Company\u2019s interest expense will be reduced as there will not be any further amortization of the debt discount due to the derecognition of the equity component that represents the value of the conversion option on the issuance date of the Notes. In addition, adoption of this ASU requires the use of the if-converted method for all convertible notes in the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation and the inclusion of the effect of potential share settlement of the convertible notes, if the effective is more dilutive. No impact to the number of potentially dilutive shares is expected upon adoption. Adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the Company\u2019s liquidity or cash flows.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU is intended to provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, to ease the potential accounting and financial reporting burden associated with the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. This ASU may be applied as of the beginning of any interim period that includes its effective date (i.e., March 12, 2020) through December 31, 2022. The Company will adopt this standard when LIBOR is discontinued and does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815. This ASU was issued to clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under ASC 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ASC 323 and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. With respect to the interactions between ASC 321 and ASC 323, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting when applying the measurement alternative in ASC 321, immediately before applying or discontinuing the equity method of accounting. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The amendments in this ASU include removal of certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 related to recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intraperiod tax allocation and calculating income taxes in an interim period. The ASU also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes, including the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\n3. Business Combination\nOn November 16, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of edX pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2021 (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d). The total preliminary purchase price was $773.0 million in cash consideration, of which $23.0 million was distributed to an escrow account to satisfy indemnification claims and purchase price adjustments, as applicable. The preliminary purchase price is subject to customary adjustments based on, among other things, the finalization of working capital as of the closing date. The Company recorded $14.8 million and $0.3 million of acquisition costs in general and administrative expense related to this acquisition during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and revenue of $5.2 million and operating expense of $14.4 million have been included in the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations since the date of acquisition.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total preliminary purchase price was allocated to edX\u2019s net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of November 16, 2021. The\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n3. Business Combination (Continued)\nallocation of the preliminary purchase price is pending the finalization of the acquired company\u2019s working capital as of the closing date and the finalization of the fair value of acquired deferred revenue and other liabilities, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and assumed non-income tax liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation based on the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition:\nOf the total preliminary purchase price, the Company allocated $255.0 million and $133.7 million to indefinite-lived intangibles and definite-lived intangibles, respectively. The estimated values of the definite-lived intangibles is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The methodologies utilized to determine the estimated fair values of the acquired intangible assets are Level 3 measurements.\nThe acquired indefinite-lived intangible asset represents the established edX trade name that we expect to be the primary brand for the Company\u2019s marketplace, educational offerings and services. Acquired client relationships represent agreements with existing clients as of the acquisition date. The fair values of the trade name and the client relationships were determined using the discounted cash flow method. Under this method, the Company\u2019s significant assumptions and estimates included expected future cash flows and the weighted-average cost of capital.\nThe acquired developed technology represents technology that had reached technological feasibility and for which development had been completed as of the date of the Acquisition. The Company utilized the relief-from-royalty valuation method to value the acquired technology. Under this method, the Company\u2019s significant assumptions and estimates included an estimated market royalty rate, remaining useful life, future revenue, and a rate of return utilized in the determination of a discounted present value.\nThe goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, expanded market opportunities and operating synergies anticipated upon the integration of the operations of the Company and edX. The goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Refer to Note 5 for details.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n3. Business Combination (Continued)\nThe Company\u2019s unaudited pro forma combined financial information below is presented for illustrative purposes and does not purport to represent what the results of operations would actually have been if the business combination occurred as of the date indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. The following table presents the Company\u2019s unaudited pro forma combined revenue, pro forma combined net loss and pro forma combined net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and and 2020, as if the acquisition of edX had occurred on January 1, 2020.\n4. Property and Equipment, Net\nThe following table presents the components of property and equipment, net on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of each of the dates indicated.\nDepreciation expense of property and equipment was $12.5 million, $13.4 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets for the periods indicated.\n* See Note 3 for a discussion of the Acquisition.\nThe Acquisition was completed within close proximity of the Company\u2019s year end and, as a result, the assignment of the preliminary goodwill balance of $423.6 million to the Company\u2019s reporting units has not been completed as of\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued)\nDecember 31, 2021. This preliminary goodwill balance will be assigned to the relevant reporting units in advance of the Company\u2019s next annual goodwill impairment test that will be performed as of October 1, 2022, or earlier, in the event of a triggering event for assessing the goodwill balance for impairment.\nThe Company experienced a sustained decline in its stock price during the third quarter of 2019, which management deemed a triggering event that required the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of September 1, 2019. The Company\u2019s test relied in part on the work of an independent valuation firm engaged to provide inputs as to the fair value of the reporting units and to assist in the related calculations and analysis. The results of the interim impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the boot camp business acquired in 2019 within the Company\u2019s Alternative Credential Segment exceeded the fair value by $70.4 million. The decrease in this reporting unit\u2019s fair value was primarily due to lower expectations of future performance due to the impact of changes in key management as well as an increased focus in integrating the operations of the newly acquired reporting unit, which impacted the estimated operating cash flows. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $70.4 million on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the third quarter of 2019. For purposes of testing the Company\u2019s goodwill for impairment, fair value measurements were determined primarily using a weighted combination of the income-based and market-based approaches. The income-based approach largely relied on inputs that were not observable to active markets, which would be deemed \u201cLevel 3\u201d fair value measurements, as defined in the Fair Value Measurements section of Note 2. These inputs included the Company\u2019s expectations about future revenue growth, profitability, income tax rates, cash flows and the rate at which cash flows should be discounted, in order to determine this fair value estimate. The primary input used in the market-based approach was publicly-available data on the financial ratios of the Company\u2019s competitors. The carrying amount of goodwill in the Alternative Credential Segment included accumulated impairment charges of $70.4 million as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following table presents the components of intangible assets, net on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of each of the dates indicated.\nThe amounts presented in the table above include $46.3 million and $38.6 million of in process capitalized technology and content development as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued)\nThe Company recorded amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets of $95.9 million, $83.1 million and $58.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table presents the estimated future amortization expense of the Company\u2019s amortizable intangible assets placed in service as of December 31, 2021.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n6. Other Balance Sheet Details\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had balances of $23.0 million and $14.0 million, respectively, of prepaid assets within prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nOther Assets, Non-current\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had balances of $7.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively, of deferred expenses incurred to integrate the software associated with its cloud computing arrangements, within other assets, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. Such expenses are subject to amortization over the remaining contractual term of the associated cloud computing arrangement, with a useful life of between three to five years. The Company incurred $2.4 million, $1.3 million, and $0.3 million of such amortization for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nThe following table presents the components of accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of each of the dates indicated.\nOther Current Liabilities\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had a balance of $21.9 million within other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, which represents proceeds received from students enrolled in certain of the Company\u2019s alternative credential offerings that are payable to associated university client.\nIn response to COVID-19, various government programs have been announced to provide financial relief for affected businesses. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), which was enacted in the United States on March 27, 2020, the Company is allowed to defer payment of the employer\u2019s share of Social Security taxes incurred from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020. In addition, the CARES Act provides eligible employers with an employee retention tax credit for employees whose services were impacted by COVID-19. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of payroll taxes subject to deferred payment, net of employee retention tax credits of $0.5 million, was approximately $5.0 million. The balance is recorded within other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n7. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. While the Company does not expect that the ultimate resolution of any existing claims and proceedings (other than the specific matters described below, if decided adversely), individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, an unfavorable outcome in some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on the Company\u2019s current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. With respect to current legal proceedings, the Company does not believe it is probable a material loss exceeding amounts already recognized has been incurred as of the date of the balance sheets presented herein. As such, the Company\u2019s view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future.\nIn re 2U, Inc., Securities Class Action\nOn August 7 and 9, 2019, Aaron Harper and Anne M. Chinn filed putative class action complaints against the Company, Christopher J. Paucek, the Company\u2019s CEO, and Catherine A. Graham, the Company\u2019s former CFO, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based upon allegedly false and misleading statements regarding the Company\u2019s business prospects and financial projections. The district court transferred the cases to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, consolidated them under docket number 8:19-cv-3455 (D.

On August 5, 2021, the court largely denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. On February 18, 2022, the court stayed discovery until April 19, 2022, pending mediation. The Company believes that the claims are without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend against these claims. However, due to the complex nature of the legal and factual issues involved, the outcome of this matter is not presently determinable.\nStockholder Derivative Suits\nOn April 30, 2020, Richard Theis filed a stockholder derivative complaint purportedly on behalf of the Company and against Christopher J.

In addition, certain agreements in the Degree Program Segment require the Company to invest up to agreed-upon levels in marketing the programs to achieve specified program performance. The Company believes it is currently in compliance with all such commitments.\nFuture Minimum Payments to University Clients\nPursuant to certain of the Company\u2019s contracts in the Degree Program Segment, the Company has made, or is obligated to make, payments to university clients in exchange for contract extensions and various marketing and other rights. Generally, these amounts are capitalized as other assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, and amortized as contra revenue over the life of the contract, commencing on the later of when payment is due or when contract revenue recognition begins.\nThe following table presents the estimated future minimum payments due to university clients as of December 31, 2021.\nContingent Payments\nThe Company has entered into agreements with certain of its university clients in the Degree Program Segment that require the Company to make future minimum payments in the event that certain program metrics are not achieved on an annual basis. The Company recognizes any estimated contingent payments under these agreements as contra revenue over the period to which they relate, and records a liability in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to make investments in an education technology company of up to $15.0 million, upon demand by the investee. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company sold its investment in this education technology company and was released from any further obligation to make additional investments.\n8. Leases\nThe Company leases facilities under non-cancellable operating leases primarily in the United States, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Canada. The Company\u2019s operating leases have remaining lease terms of between less than one to 12 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to five years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one year. These options to extend the terms of the Company\u2019s operating leases were not deemed to be reasonably certain of exercise as of lease commencement and are therefore not included in the determination of their respective non-cancellable lease terms. The future lease payments due under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements contain fixed rent increases over the term of the lease. The Company also leases office equipment under non-cancellable leases.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n8. Leases (Continued)\nIn October 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with an unrelated party to sublease a portion of the Company\u2019s office space in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, this sublease was classified as an operating lease and had a remaining term of 1.8 years, with scheduled annual rent increases and no option to extend or renew the sublease term. Sublease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the sublease term as a reduction to expense incurred by the Company under the associated head lease.\nIn August 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with an unrelated party to sublease a portion of the Company\u2019s office space in Denver, Colorado, as part of its overall real estate management strategy. As of December 31, 2021, this sublease was classified as an operating lease and had a remaining term of 2.9 years with scheduled annual rent increases and no option to extend or renew the sublease term. Sublease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the sublease term as a reduction to expense incurred by the Company under the associated master lease. In connection with the execution of this agreement, the Company recognized a loss on sublease of $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2021.\nThe following table presents the components of lease expense on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for each of the periods indicated.\nAs of December 31, 2021, for the Company\u2019s operating leases, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 7.7 years and the weighted-average discount rate was 11.2%. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $21.7 million and $17.3 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets were $28.0 million and $26.7 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents the maturities of the Company\u2019s operating lease liabilities as of the date indicated, and excludes the impact of future sublease income totaling $4.4 million in aggregate.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had additional operating leases for facilities that have not yet commenced with future minimum lease payments of approximately $5.8 million. Each of these operating leases will commence during the fiscal year ending 2022 and have lease terms of approximately 8 years.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n9. Debt\nThe following table presents the components of outstanding long-term debt on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of each of the dates indicated.\nThe Company believes the carrying value of its long-term debt approximates the fair value of the debt as the terms and interest rates approximate the market rates, other than the 2.25% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), which had an estimated fair value of $403.3 million and $616.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Each of the Company\u2019s long-term debt instruments were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company\u2019s cash interest payments, net of amounts capitalized, were $25.5 million, $10.8 million and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTerm Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement\nThe Company entered into a Term Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated June 28, 2021 (the \u201cTerm Loan Agreement\u201d), among the Company, as borrower, the subsidiaries of the Company party thereto, as guarantors, the lenders party thereto, and Alter Domus (US) LLC as administrative agent and collateral agent. Pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement, the lenders thereunder made term loans to the Company on June 29, 2021 (the \u201cFunding Date\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $475 million (the \u201cTerm Loan Facilities\u201d). The Term Loan Facilities have an initial maturity date of December 28, 2024 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). Commencing on the Funding Date, loans under the Term Loan Facilities will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to a base rate or adjusted Eurodollar rate, as applicable, plus the applicable margin of 4.75% in the case of the base rate loans and 5.75% in the case of the Eurodollar loans. The Term Loan Agreement requires the Company to make quarterly principal repayments equal to 0.25% of the $475 million aggregate principal amount, beginning September 2021. If the loans under the Term Loan Facilities are prepaid prior to the second anniversary, subject to certain customary exceptions, the Company shall pay the Applicable Premium (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) on the amount of the loans so prepaid.\nOn November 4, 2021, the Company entered into a First Amendment to Term Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement and a Joinder Agreement, which amended the Term Loan Agreement (collectively, the \u201cAmended Term Loan Facility\u201d) primarily to provide for an incremental facility to the Company in an original principal amount of $100 million. The Company is required to make quarterly principal repayments equal to 0.25% of this original principal amount beginning in December 2021. The proceeds of the Amended Term Loan Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.\nThe associated effective interest rate of the Amended Term Loan Facility for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 7.56% and the associated interest expense was approximately $19.5 million.\nThe obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries (the Company and the guarantors, collectively, the \u201cCredit Parties\u201d). The obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed-upon exceptions, by a perfected security interest in all tangible and intangible assets of the Credit Parties, except for certain customary excluded assets.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n9. Debt (Continued)\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including, among others, the provision of annual and quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates, maintenance of property, insurance, compliance with laws and environmental matters. The Term Loan Agreement contains customary negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness, granting of liens, making investments and acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchases of equity interests in the Company and entering into affiliate transactions and asset sales. The Term Loan Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain minimum Recurring Revenues (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Company commencing with fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021 through the Maturity Date. The Term Loan Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including, among others: non-payment of obligations; bankruptcy or insolvency event; failure to comply with covenants; breach of representations or warranties; defaults on other material indebtedness; impairment of any lien on any material portion of the Collateral (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement); failure of any material provision of the Term Loan Agreement or any guaranty to remain in full force and effect; a change of control of the Company; and material judgment defaults. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations under the Term Loan Agreement.\nIf an event of default under the Term Loan Agreement occurs and is continuing, then, at the request (or with the consent) of the lenders holding a majority of the commitments and loans under the Term Loan Agreement, upon notice by the administrative agent to the borrowers, the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement shall become immediately due and payable. In addition, if the Credit Parties become the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Agreement will automatically become immediately due and payable.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain other lenders party thereto that provided for $50 million in revolving loans (the \u201cLoans\u201d). The Credit Agreement allowed for incremental borrowings from time to time in an aggregate amount for all such incremental amounts not to exceed (i) the lesser of (x) $50 million and (y) an amount such that the aggregate principal amount of the lenders\u2019 commitments under the revolving credit facility does not exceed $100 million, plus (ii) certain specified prepayments of indebtedness, plus (iii) an unlimited amount subject to satisfaction of a leverage ratio based compliance test.\nThe Loans bore interest, at the Company\u2019s option, at variable rates based on (i) a customary base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate (with a floor of 0.00%) for the interest period relevant to such borrowing plus an applicable margin of 3.75%. In connection with entering into the Term Loan Agreement in June 2021, the Company terminated the Credit Agreement and recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $1.1 million in connection with the write-off of previously capitalized deferred financing costs and associated fees.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn April 2020, the Company issued the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $380 million, including the exercise by the initial purchasers of an option to purchase additional Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds from the offering of the Notes were approximately $369.6 million after deducting the initial purchasers\u2019 discounts, commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company.\nThe Notes are governed by an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2020. The Notes will mature on May 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The interest expense related to the Notes, including amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs, was $30.9 million and $19.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The associated effective interest rate of the Notes was approximately 11.0% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Notes are the senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and are equal in right of payment with the Company\u2019s senior unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes, effectively subordinated to the Company\u2019s senior secured indebtedness (including indebtedness under the Term Loan Facilities), to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n9. Debt (Continued)\nIn accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated using a discount rate of 10.3%, which was determined by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option, excluding debt issuance costs, was $117.8 million and was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The Company allocated debt issuance costs of $7.2 million and $3.2 million to the debt and equity components, respectively. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount, inclusive of debt issuance costs, represents the debt discount, which is amortized to interest expense at an annual effective interest rate over the contractual term of the Notes. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the unamortized debt discount was $88.7 million and $111.0 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component of the Notes was $291.3 million and $269.0 million.\nHolders may convert their Notes at their option in the following circumstances:\n\u2022during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock, exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter;\n\u2022during the five consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period (such 10 consecutive trading day period, the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day;\n\u2022upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on the Company\u2019s common stock, as provided in the Indenture;\n\u2022if the Company calls such Notes for redemption; and\n\u2022at any time from, and including, November 1, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date.\nThe initial conversion rate for the Notes is 35.3773 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $28.27 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock, and is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the Indenture. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. In the event of the Company calling the Notes for redemption or the holders of the Notes electing to convert their Notes, the Company will determine whether to settle in cash, common stock or a combination thereof. Upon the occurrence of a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture), the Company will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time. As of December 31, 2021, the if-converted value of the Notes did not exceed the principal amount.\nIn addition, upon the occurrence of a \u201cfundamental change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nThe Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company\u2019s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after May 5, 2023 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company\u2019s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice, and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a \u201cmake-whole fundamental change\u201d with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if such Note is converted after it is called for redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n9. Debt (Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2021, the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had not been met and the Company has the right under the Indenture to determine the method of settlement at the time of conversion, and the Notes, therefore, are classified as a non-current on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn connection with the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the \u201cCapped Call Transactions\u201d) with certain counterparties. The Capped Call Transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company\u2019s common stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap, based on the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially $44.34 per share. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was approximately $50.5 million.\nIn April 2020, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay in full all amounts outstanding, and discharge all obligations in respect of, the $250 million senior secured term loan facility. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the Notes for working capital or other general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.\nDeferred Government Grant Obligations\nGovernment grants awarded to the Company in the form of forgivable loans are recorded within long-term debt on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets until all contingencies are resolved and the grants are determined to be realized. The Company has a total of two outstanding conditional loan agreements with Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland and the State of Maryland for an aggregate amount of $3.5 million, each bearing an interest rate of 3% per annum. These agreements are conditional loan obligations that may be forgiven, provided that the Company attains certain conditions related to employment levels at 2U\u2019s Lanham, Maryland headquarters.\nIn July 2020, the Company amended its conditional loan agreement with Prince George\u2019s County to modify the terms of the employment level thresholds. The conditional loan with Prince George\u2019s County has a maturity date of June 22, 2027.\nIn January 2021, the Company amended its conditional loan agreement with the State of Maryland to modify the terms of the employment level thresholds and extend the maturity date to June 30, 2028.\nThe interest expense related to these loans for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was immaterial. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company\u2019s combined accrued interest balance associated with the deferred government grant obligations was $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nLetters of Credit\nCertain of the Company\u2019s operating lease agreements entered into require security deposits in the form of cash or an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has entered into standby letters of credit totaling $16.2 million as security deposits for the applicable leased facilities and in connection with the deferred government grant obligations.\nThe Company maintains restricted cash as collateral for standby letters of credit for the Company\u2019s leased facilities and in connection with the deferred government grant obligations.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n9. Debt (Continued)\nFuture Principal Payments\nFuture principal payments under the Amended Term Loan Facility, the Notes, and the government grants, as of the date indicated are as follows:\n* Amounts represent conditional loan obligations that may be forgiven, provided that the Company attains certain conditions related to employment levels at 2U\u2019s Lanham, Maryland headquarters.\n10. Other Income (Expense)\nThe following table presents the components of other income (expense) on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for each of the periods indicated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $27.8 million on the sale of its interest in an education technology company. Refer to Note 7 for further information.\n11. Income Taxes\nThe following table presents the components of loss before income taxes on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for each of the periods indicated.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n11. Income Taxes (Continued)\nThe following table presents the components of the income tax benefit (provision) on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for each of the periods indicated.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation between the Company\u2019s statutory federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate for each of the periods indicated.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n11. Income Taxes (Continued)\nThe following table presents the significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of each of the dates indicated.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had a U.S. net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforward of approximately $793.9 million, of which $265.0 million expires between 2029 and 2037. In accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), U.S. NOLs arising in a tax year ending after 2017 will not expire. The Company has generated $528.9 million of U.S. NOLs in tax years ending after 2017. The gross amount of the state NOL carryforwards is equal to or less than the federal NOL carryforwards and expires over various periods based on individual state tax laws. The Company also has an NOL carryforward of $27.3 million in its foreign jurisdictions, of which $1.2 million begins to expire in 2038 and the remainder will not expire. A full valuation allowance has been established to offset its net deferred tax assets in the U.S., and certain foreign jurisdictions as the Company has not generated taxable income since inception and does not have sufficient deferred tax liabilities to recover the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the beginning valuation allowance in Australia of $0.8 million was released as management has concluded, based on the evaluation of the positive and negative evidence, that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realizable. The total increase in the valuation allowance was $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The utilization of the NOL carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on the Company\u2019s ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL carryforwards. Under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 382, certain substantial changes in the Company\u2019s ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and taxes payable. The Company does not expect such limitation, if any, to impact the use of the net operating losses prior to their expiration.\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of approximately $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to recording of a U.S. deferred tax liability. The deferred tax liability was recorded to account for the book vs. tax basis difference related to the acquired edX indefinite lived intangibles (including goodwill), also known as a \u201cnaked credit\u201d. The deferred tax liability was excluded from sources of future taxable income available to realize definite lived deferred tax assets, as the timing of its reversal cannot be predicted due to the indefinite life of the intangibles. In accordance with the Tax Act,\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n11. Income Taxes (Continued)\nlosses generated beginning with the 2018 tax year may be carried forward indefinitely for U.S. federal tax purposes, however utilization is limited to offsetting 80% of taxable income in future years. Thus, 80% of the U.S. deferred tax liability related to the edX indefinite lived intangibles was able to be used as a source of income to realize the indefinite lived deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021.\nA one-time tax benefit of approximately $17.5 million related to the acquisition of Trilogy was included in the Company\u2019s income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019. This one-time benefit relates to the release of the Company\u2019s tax valuation allowance that was no longer needed as a result of recognizing an additional net deferred tax liability, due to the acquisition of Trilogy.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has not recognized any amounts for uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company has analyzed its filing positions in all significant federal, state and foreign jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as open tax years in these jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for the years prior to 2018, though the NOL carryforwards can be adjusted upon audit and could impact taxes owed in open tax years. No income tax returns are currently under examination by the taxing authorities.\nThe Tax Act includes Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) provisions that require a company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary\u2019s tangible assets. Due to foreign subsidiary losses, this provision did not apply to the Company in 2021. Another significant section of the Tax Act, the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d), did not apply to the Company\u2019s 2021 tax year as the Company\u2019s base erosion payments are less than 3% of the Company\u2019s total deductions. As these taxes may become applicable in the future, the Company will continue to monitor the potential impact.\n12. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nCommon Stock\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company was authorized to issue 205,000,000 total shares of capital stock, consisting of 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, there were 75,754,663 shares of common stock outstanding, and the Company had reserved a total of 24,352,021 of its authorized shares of common stock for future issuance as follows:\nOn August 6, 2020, the Company sold 6,800,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to the public. The Company received net proceeds of $299.8 million, which the Company uses for working capital and other general corporate purposes. On May 22, 2019, the Company issued 4,608,101 shares of common stock in connection with its acquisition of Trilogy. On May 22, 2018, the Company sold 3,833,334 shares of its common stock to the public, including 500,000 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 over-allotment option, and received net proceeds of $330.9 million.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company maintains two stock-based compensation plans: the Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) and the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2008 Plan\u201d and together with the 2014 Plan, the \u201cStock Plans\u201d). Upon the effective date of the 2014 Plan in January 2014, the Company ceased using the 2008 Plan to grant new equity awards.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n12. Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Continued)\n2014 Plan\nIn February 2014, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the 2014 Plan. The 2014 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to the Company\u2019s employees and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards and other forms of stock compensation to the Company\u2019s employees, directors and consultants. The 2014 Plan also provides for the grant of performance-based cash awards to the Company\u2019s employees, directors and consultants.\nA total of 2,800,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock were initially reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2014 Plan. In addition, the shares reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan include (a) those shares reserved but unissued under the 2008 Plan, and (b) shares returned to the 2008 Plan as the result of expiration or termination of awards (provided that the maximum number of shares that may be added to the 2014 Plan pursuant to (a) and (b) is 5,943,348 shares). The number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock that may be issued under the 2014 Plan will automatically increase on January 1st of each year, for a period of ten years, from January 1, 2015 continuing through January 1, 2024, by 5% of the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors. The shares available for future issuance under the 2014 Plan increased by 3,782,719 and 3,619,344 on January 1, 2022 and 2021, respectively, pursuant to the automatic share reserve increase provision in the 2014 Plan.\nIn addition, shares subject to outstanding stock awards granted under the 2008 Plan and 2014 Plan that (i) expire or terminate for any reason prior to exercise or settlement; (ii) are forfeited because of the failure to meet a contingency or condition required to vest such shares or otherwise return to the Company; or (iii) are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation in connection with an award or to satisfy the purchase price or exercise price of a stock award, return to the 2014 Plan\u2019s share reserve and become available for future grant under the 2014 Plan, up to the maximum number of shares of 5,943,348.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had 7,465,698 shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. Further, as of December 31, 2021, under the 2014 Plan, options to purchase 2,593,719 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock were outstanding at a weighted-average exercise price of $46.38 per share, and 2,613,063 RSUs and 1,121,277 PRSUs were also outstanding.\n2008 Plan\nIn October 2008, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the Company\u2019s 2008 Plan. The 2008 Plan was most recently amended on May 8, 2013. The 2008 Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options to the Company\u2019s employees and the employees of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards and deferred stock awards to the Company\u2019s employees, directors and consultants. The Company ceased granting equity awards under the 2008 Plan, and accordingly, as of January 30, 2014, no shares were available for future grant under the 2008 Plan. However, the 2008 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of outstanding awards granted thereunder.\nAs of December 31, 2021, options to purchase 883,720 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock were outstanding under the 2008 Plan at a weighted-average exercise price of $6.04 per share.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company also has an ESPP. The Company\u2019s ESPP provides (i) for two offering periods each year and (ii) that the purchase price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock purchased under the ESPP will be 90% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the purchase date or the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the first day of the offering period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation committee of the Company\u2019s board of directors may exercise its discretion, subject to certain conditions, to make changes to certain aspects of the ESPP including, but not limited to, the length of the offering periods and that the purchase price will be 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the purchase date or the fair market value of 2U\u2019s common stock on the first day of the offering period. Participating eligible employees select a rate of payroll deduction between 1% and 15% of their salary or wage compensation received from the Company as in effect at the start of the offering period, with the aggregate purchase limited to a maximum fair market value of $25,000 per employee per year. Participation in the ESPP began on January 1, 2018. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. A maximum of 1,000,000 shares of 2U\u2019s common stock may be issued under the ESPP, subject to adjustments for certain capital transactions.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n12. Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Continued)\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, an aggregate of 150,685 and 146,570 shares, respectively, of the Company\u2019s common stock were purchased in accordance with the ESPP. Net proceeds from the issuance of these shares were $3.6 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 515,709 shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table presents stock-based compensation expense related to the Stock Plans and the ESPP, contained on the following line items on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for each of the periods indicated. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe 2014 Plan provides for the issuance of RSUs to employees and consultants. RSUs generally vest over a three- or four-year period. The terms of these grants under the 2014 Plan, including the vesting periods, are determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors or the compensation committee, or a subcommittee thereof.\nThroughout 2021 and 2020, the Company granted RSUs under the 2014 Plan to the Company\u2019s directors and certain of the Company\u2019s employees and certain consultants. The terms of the restricted stock unit grants under the 2014 Plan, including the vesting periods, are determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors or the compensation committee thereof. Restricted stock units are generally subject to service-based vesting conditions and vest at various times from the date of the grant, with most restricted stock units vesting in equal annual tranches, generally over a period of three to four years.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company\u2019s RSU activity for the period indicated.\nThe total compensation cost related to the unvested RSUs not yet recognized as of December 31, 2021 was $56.6 million and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.4 years.\nPerformance Restricted Stock Units\nThe 2014 Plan provides for the issuance of PRSUs to employees and consultants. PRSUs generally include both service conditions and market conditions related to total shareholder return targets relative to that of companies comprising the Russell 3000 Index.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n12. Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Continued)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company granted 1.3 million PRSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $22.94 to certain of its employees. These PRSU awards are subject to vesting over a period of three years, based on the Company\u2019s stock price achieving predetermined total shareholder return targets relative to that of companies comprising the Russell 3000 Index during each of the one, two and three-year vesting periods. The PRSU award agreements provide that the quantity of units subject to vesting may range from 200% to 0% of the granted quantities, depending on the achievement of market-based targets. The expense recognized each period is determined at the time of grant and not subject to fluctuation due to the achievement of market-based targets. In each of the fourth quarters ending 2020 and 2021, as a result of the achievement of market-based targets for the first and second performance periods of these PRSUs, 200% of the eligible units vested.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, as part of its annual equity awards cycle, the Company awarded 1.9 million PRSUs with an aggregate intrinsic value of $37.8 million. Of these PRSUs, 0.6 million were granted in January 2020 with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $22.45, and 0.6 million were granted in January 2021 with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $61.14. These PRSU awards are subject to vesting over respective one year periods, based on the Company\u2019s stock price achieving predetermined total shareholder return targets relative to that of companies comprising the Russell 3000 Index. The PRSU award agreements provide that the quantity of units subject to vesting may range from 200% to 0% of the granted quantities for each of the first and second performance periods, depending on the achievement of market-based targets. The expense recognized each period is determined at the time of grant and not subject to fluctuation due to the achievement of market-based targets. In January 2021, as a result of the achievement of market-based targets for the first performance period of these PRSUs, 200% of the granted quantities vested. In January 2022, as a result of not achieving the market-based targets for the second performance period of these PRSUs, 0% of the granted quantities vested. Achievement percentages applicable to each performance period will be determined prior to the grant date.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, as part of its annual equity awards cycle, the Company awarded 0.4 million PRSUs with an aggregate intrinsic value of $20.0 million. Of these PRSUs, 0.1 million were granted with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $40.69. Certain of these PRSU awards are subject to vesting over a period of one year, while certain other of these awards are subject to vesting over a period of three years, all of which are based on the Company\u2019s internal financial performance achieving predetermined targets. The PRSU award agreements provide that the quantity of units subject to vesting may range from 200% to 0% of the granted quantities for the first performance period, depending on the achievement of internal financial performance-based targets. The expense recognized each period is estimated at the time of grant and is subject to fluctuation due to the achievement of internal financial performance-based targets. In January 2022, as a result of the achievement of internal financial performance-based targets for the first performance period of these PRSUs, 112.7% of the goals were achieved, and the PRSUs subject to a one-year service period vested. Achievement percentages applicable to each performance period will be determined prior to the grant date.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, as part of its annual equity awards cycle, the Company granted 0.2 million PRSUs with an aggregate intrinsic value of $9.1 million and a weighted-average grant date fair value of $61.94. These PRSU awards are subject to vesting over a single three-year period, based on the Company\u2019s stock price achieving predetermined total shareholder return targets relative to that of companies comprising the Russell 3000 Index. The PRSU award agreements provide that the quantity of units subject to vesting may range from 200% to 0% of the granted quantities for the performance period, depending on the achievement of market-based targets. The expense recognized each period is determined at the time of grant and not subject to fluctuation due to the achievement of market-based targets.\nThe Company values PRSUs subject to market-based vesting conditions using a Monte Carlo valuation model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the performance period. The expected life is consistent with the performance period of the awards. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock over the estimated expected life. The Company assumes no dividend yield because dividends are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with the Company\u2019s history of not declaring or paying dividends to date.\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair values of the PRSUs subject to market-based vesting conditions that were granted for the periods presented.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n12. Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Continued)\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company\u2019s PRSU activity for the period indicated.\nThe total compensation cost related to the unvested PRSUs not yet recognized as of December 31, 2021 was $11.5 million and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.3 years.\nStock Options\nThe Stock Plans provide for the issuance of stock options to employees and consultants. Stock options issued under the Stock Plans generally are exercisable for periods not to exceed 10 years and generally vest over four years.\nThe terms of stock option grants, including the exercise price per share and vesting periods, are determined by the Company\u2019s board of directors or the compensation committee thereof. Stock options are granted at exercise prices of not less than the estimated fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock at the date of grant. Stock options are generally subject to service-based vesting conditions and vest at various times from the date of the grant, with most options vesting in tranches, generally over a period of four years. Stock options granted under the 2014 Plan and the 2008 Plan are subject to service-based vesting conditions, and generally expire ten years from the grant date.\nThe Company values stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life of the option, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of the Company\u2019s employee stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the \u201csimplified method.\u201d Under the \u201csimplified method,\u201d the expected life of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The Company uses the \u201csimplified method\u201d due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock over the estimated expected life of the stock options. The Company assumes no dividend yield because dividends are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with the Company\u2019s history of not declaring or paying dividends to date.\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used for estimating the fair value of the stock options granted for the periods presented. No stock options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n12. Stockholders\u2019 Equity (Continued)\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company\u2019s stock option activity for the period indicated.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $11.48 and $28.49 per share, respectively.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $6.8 million, $8.7 million and $15.4 million, respectively.\nThe total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested options as of December 31, 2021 was $8.9 million and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.\n13. Net Loss per Share\nDiluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share for all periods presented because the effects of potentially dilutive items were anti-dilutive, given the Company\u2019s net loss. The following securities have been excluded from the calculation of weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding because the effect is anti-dilutive for each of the periods indicated.\nThe following table presents the calculation of the Company\u2019s basic and diluted net loss per share for each of the periods indicated. The calculation of diluted net loss per share reflects the Company\u2019s intent to settle conversions of the Notes through a combination settlement, which contemplates repayment in cash of the principal amount and repayment in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock of any excess of the conversion value over the principal amount.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n13. Net Loss per Share (Continued)\n14. Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company has two reportable segments: the Degree Program Segment and the Alternative Credential Segment. The Company\u2019s reportable segments are determined based on (i) financial information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d), (ii) internal management and related reporting structure, and (iii) the basis upon which the CEO makes resource allocation decisions. The Company\u2019s Degree Program Segment includes the technology and services provided to nonprofit colleges and universities to enable the online delivery of degree programs. The Company\u2019s Alternative Credential Segment includes the premium online executive education programs and technical skills-based boot camps provided through relationships with nonprofit colleges and universities.\nSignificant Customers\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, no university clients accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one university client in the Degree Program Segment accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue, contributing $74.6 million, or approximately 10% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019, one university client in the Degree Program Segment accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue, contributing $83.5 million, or approximately 15% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2021, two university clients in the Degree Program Segment each accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s consolidated accounts receivable, net balance, as follows: $9.8 million and $8.8 million, which equaled 14% and 13% of the Company\u2019s consolidated accounts receivable, net balance, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, two university clients in the Degree Program Segment each accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s consolidated accounts receivable, net balance, contributing $5.8 million and $5.2 million, or approximately 12% and 11% of the Company\u2019s consolidated accounts receivable, net balance, respectively.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n14. Segment and Geographic Information (Continued)\nSegment Performance\nThe following table presents financial information regarding each of the Company\u2019s reportable segment\u2019s results of operations for each of the periods indicated.\n* The Company has excluded immaterial amounts of intersegment revenues from the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n** The Company defines segment profitability as net income or net loss, as applicable, before net interest income (expense), other income (expense), net, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, deferred revenue fair value adjustments, transaction costs, integration costs, restructuring-related costs, stockholder activism costs, certain litigation-related costs, consisting of fees for certain non-ordinary course litigation and other proceedings, impairment charges, losses on debt extinguishment, and stock-based compensation expense. Some or all of these items may not be applicable in any given reporting period.\n*** The Company defines segment profitability margin as segment profitability as a percentage of the respective segment\u2019s revenue.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n14. Segment and Geographic Information (Continued)\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the Company\u2019s total segment profitability to net loss for each of the periods indicated.\n* Includes (i) transaction and integration costs of $16.9 million, $2.3 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, (ii) restructuring-related costs of $8.5 million, $6.8 million and $10.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, (iii) stockholder activism and litigation-related costs of $2.4 million, $7.4 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and (iv) deferred revenue fair value adjustments of $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s total assets by segment as of each of the dates indicated.\nGeographical Information\nThe Company\u2019s non-U.S. revenue is based on the currency of the country in which the university client primarily operates. The Company\u2019s non-U.S. revenue was $98.5 million, $73.0 million and $40.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s non-U.S. revenue for each of the aforementioned periods was sourced from the Alternative Credential Segment\u2019s operations outside of the U.S. The Company\u2019s long-lived tangible assets in non-U.S. countries as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled approximately $3.3 million and $1.6 million, respectively.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n15. Receivables and Contract Liabilities\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nThe Company\u2019s trade accounts receivable balances relate to amounts due from students or customers occurring in the normal course of business. Trade accounts receivable balances have a term of less than one year and are included in accounts receivable, net on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents the Company\u2019s trade accounts receivable in each segment as of each of the dates indicated.\nThe following table presents the change in provision for credit losses for trade accounts receivable on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets for the period indicated.\nOther Receivables\nThe Company\u2019s other receivables are comprised of amounts due under tuition payment plans with extended payment terms from students enrolled in certain of the Company\u2019s alternative credential offerings. These payment plans, which are managed and serviced by third-party providers, are designed to assist students with paying tuition costs after all other student financial assistance and scholarships have been applied. The associated receivables generally have payment terms that range from 12 to 42 months and are recorded net of any implied pricing concessions, which are determined based on collections history, market data and any time value of money component. There are no fees or origination costs included in these receivables. The carrying value of these receivable balances approximate their fair value. The following table presents the components of the Company\u2019s other receivables, net, as of each of the dates indicated.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n15. Receivables and Contract Liabilities (Continued)\nThe following table presents the change in provision for credit losses for other receivables on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets for the period indicated.\nThe Company considers receivables to be past due when amounts contractually due under the extended payment plans have not been paid. As of December 31, 2021, 93% of other receivables, net due under extended payment plans were current.\nAt the time of origination, the Company categorizes its other receivables using a credit quality indicator based on the credit tier rankings obtained from the third-party providers that manage and service the payment plans. The third-party providers utilize credit rating agency data to determine the credit tier rankings. The Company monitors the collectability of its other receivables on an ongoing basis. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined through analysis of multiple factors, including industry trends, portfolio performance, and delinquency rates. The following tables present other receivables, at amortized cost including interest accretion, by credit quality indicator and year of origination, as of the dates indicated.\n2U, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n15. Receivables and Contract Liabilities (Continued)\nContract Liabilities\nThe Company\u2019s deferred revenue represents contract liabilities. The Company generally receives payments from Degree Program Segment university clients early in each academic term and from Alternative Credential Segment students, either in full upon registration for the course or in full before the end of the course based on a payment plan, prior to completion of the service period. These payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are delivered or until the Company\u2019s obligations are otherwise met, at which time revenue is recognized. The following table presents the Company\u2019s contract liabilities in each segment as of each of the dates indicated.\nFor the Degree Program Segment, revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 that was included in the deferred revenue balance that existed at the end of each preceding year was $1.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively.\nFor the Alternative Credential Segment, revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 that was included in the deferred revenue balance that existed at the end of each preceding year was $71.9 million and $46.6 million, respectively.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nThe Degree Program Segment had $0.5 million and $0.5 million of net capitalized contract acquisition costs recorded primarily within other assets, non-current on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company capitalized an immaterial amount of contract acquisition costs and recorded an immaterial amount of associated amortization expense in the Degree Program Segment.\n16. Retirement Plan\nThe Company has established a 401(k) plan for eligible employees to contribute up to 100% of their compensation, limited by the IRS-imposed maximum contribution amount. The Company matches 100% of the first 2% of each employee\u2019s contribution, and 50% of the next 4% of each employee\u2019s contribution, each plan year. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company made employer contributions of $7.8 million, $3.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively.\n17. Subsequent Event\nSubsequent to year-end and through the date of this filing, the Company has experienced a significant decline in its market capitalization, from $1.5 billion to $0.8 billion. Management is evaluating whether this decline represents a triggering event for assessing the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances for impairment in the first quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the balances of the Company\u2019s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset were $834.5 million and $255.0 million, respectively.",
